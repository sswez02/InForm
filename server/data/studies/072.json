    "abstract": "Although creatine supplementation is well-known to increase exercise performance in acute \nhigh-intensity exercises, its role in aerobic performance based on vO2max is more controversial. \nThus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of creatine supplementation \non vO2max. PubMed, Cochrane, embase, and ScienceDirect were searched for randomized controlled \ntrials (RCTs) reporting vO2max in creatine supplementation and placebo groups before and after \nsupplementation. we computed a random-effects meta-analysis on vO2max at baseline, within \ngroups following supplementation, on changes on vO2max between groups, and after \nsupplementation between groups. Sensitivity analyses and meta-regression were conducted. we \nincluded 19 RCTs for a total of 424 individuals (mean age 30 years old, 82% men). vO2max did \nnot differ at baseline between groups (creatine and placebo). Participants in both groups were \nengaged in exercise interventions in most studies (80%). Using changes in vO2max, vO 2max \nincreased in both groups but increased less after creatine supplementation than placebo (effect \nsize [eS] = −0.32, 95%Ci = −0.51 to −0.12, p = 0.002). Comparisons after creatine supplementation \nconfirmed a lower vO2max in the creatine group compared to the placebo group ( eS= −0.20, \n95%Ci = −0.39 to −0.001, p = 0.049). Meta-analysis after exclusion from meta-funnel resulted in \nsimilar outcomes in a subgroup of young and healthy participants. Meta-regressions on characteristics \nof supplementation, physical training, or sociodemographic were not statistically significant. Creatine \nsupplementation has a negative effect on vO2max, regardless of the characteristics of training, \nsupplementation, or population characteristics.",
    "introduction": "Creatine (Cr) is known as one of the most popular sport \ndietary supplements on the market, which is widely used \namong recreational and professional athletes, with more than \n$400 million in annual sales (Momaya, Fawal, and Estes \n2015). The popularity of Cr supplementation (CS) can be \nexplained by intensive marketing about its ergogenic effects, \nparticularly in sports performance. It’s primarily admitted \nthat CS improves performance in acute and high-intensity \nexercises such as sprints (Dawson et  al. 1995) and muscle \nstrength (Lanhers et  al. 2015; Lanhers et  al. 2017) and has \nhealth and potential therapeutic benefits (Kreider and Stout \n2021). Despite this, the current scientific literature diverges \non its potential effects on endurance performance (Engelhardt \net  al. 1998; Preen et  al. 2001). The gold standard to assess \nendurance capacities is VO 2max (“VO2 Max – an Overview \n| ScienceDirect Topics” 2021). VO 2max is defined as the \noxygen uptake attained during maximal exercise intensity \nthat could not be increased despite further increases in \nexercise workload (Hill and Lupton 1923). VO 2 is the oxygen \nflow taken by the lungs, transported through the blood \ncirculation coupled with hemoglobin, and used to oxidation \nof energy substrates (glucose and fatty acids) in the respi-\nratory chain of mitochondria resulting in Adenosine tri-\nphosphate (ATP) resynthesis (Bassett 2000). It was \ndemonstrated that VO 2max is a valid index measuring the \n© 2021 taylor & Francis Group, ll C\nCONTACT Frédéric d utheil frederic.dutheil@uca.fr\n supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2021.2008864.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2021.2008864\nKEYWORDS\ndietary supplement; \nendurance; cardiorespiratory \nfitness; vo 2peak; ventilatory \nthreshold\n\n2 D.

The increase in VO 2max \nfollowing training",
    "results": "primarily from an increase in max-\nimal cardiac output (Lanferdini et  al. 2020; Kipp, Kram, \nand Hoogkamer 2019).\nMoreover, the assessment of VO 2max through an incre-\nmental exercise test seems to be one of the most reproduc-\nible measurements, irrespective of the protocols used \n(Chidnok et  al. 2013). Some studies have investigated the \neffect of CS on VO 2max (Balsom et  al. 1993; Nelson et  al. \n2000). The ATP energy supply by the energy-rich phosphate \nbond of phosphocreatine (CrP) occurs during the first sec-\nonds of a high-intensity exercise in anaerobic conditions \ndue to the limited CrP stores requiring a recovery period \nof several minutes before its regeneration (Gastin 2001). In \nprolonged efforts, Cr could interact with aerobic metabolism \nthrough several lesser-known mechanisms with a Cr phos-\nphate shuttle facilitating the ATP transport from the mito-\nchondria to the cytosol within the cell needing ATP for \nmuscle contraction (Wallimann, Tokarska-Schlattner, and \nSchlattner 2011). It also has a role in increasing glycogen \nstorage with an increase in GLUT4 transporters (Ju et  al. \n2005; Eijnde et  al. 2001) and changes in cell volume with \nthe osmotic effect of Cr (Loon et  al. 2004). In addition to \nits role in the regulation and homeostasis of energy metab-\nolism, CS could improve muscle activation (Da Silva Azevedo \net al. 2019) and VO 2 kinetics at the same workloads (Murphy \net  al. 2005; Hickner et  al. 2010), which may be beneficial \nfor endurance performance. Besides its common use in \nsports, CS has also been evaluated in the elderly and certain \npathological conditions (Canete et  al. 2006; Carvalho et  al. \n2012). Despite these considerations, the effects of CS on \naerobic performance remain uncertain. To date, no \nmeta-analysis study has specifically focused on its effects \non changes in VO 2max.\nThus, we aimed to conduct a systematic review and \nmeta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) \ncomparing the effects of CS versus placebo on VO 2max. \nSecondary aims were to determine the influence of popu-\nlation characteristics, supplementation, and physical training \nassociated with VO 2max and assess the effects of CS on \naerobic measures associated with VO 2max during incremen-\ntal exercise tests (Poole and Jones 2017).",

    "methods": "Literature search\nWe searched for all RCTs with CS versus placebo, with a \nmeasure of VO 2max before and after supplementation. \nPubMed, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials \n(CENTRAL), Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), and \nScienceDirect were searched until March 16th 2021, using \nthe keywords “VO 2max” AND “creatine supplementation” \n(see detailed search strategy in Appendix S1). The search \nwas not limited to specific years. No language restrictions \nwere applied. Reference lists of all publications meeting the \ninclusion criteria were manually searched to identify any \nfurther studies not found through electronic searching. Two \nauthors (DG and CL) conducted all literature searches, sep-\narately reviewed and collated the abstracts, and decided the \nsuitability of the articles for inclusion based on the selection \ncriteria. A third author (FD) was asked to review the articles \nwhen consensus on suitability was not met. Then, all authors \nreviewed the eligible articles (Figure 1). We followed the \nPRISMA guidelines (Appendix S7).\nData collection\nThe data collection included the first author’s name, pub-\nlication year, study design, periods of studies, aims and \noutcomes of included articles, sample size, characteristics of \nindividuals (age, gender, physical activity, and health status), \nsupplementation protocol (type of Cr, total time of supple-\nmentation, and total dose), physical training during supple-\nmentation period, VO 2max (values in each unit, and \nmeasurement method), and performance associated with the \nincremental tests (ventilatory threshold, time to exhaustion, \nand/or maximal power output).\nOutcomes\nThe main outcome for our meta-analysis was VO 2max. Our \nsecondary outcomes were ventilatory threshold, time to \nexhaustion, and maximal power output from incremental \nexercise tests if measures were available.\n\nCRiTiCAL ReviewS in FOOD SCienCe AnD nUTRiTiOn 3\nQuality of assessment\nThe Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) \nchecklist for RCTs was used to assess the quality of reporting \n(Figure 2) (“Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network Sign \n50: A Guideline Developer’s Handbook. [(Accessed on 1 \nAugust 2019)]; Available Online: http://www.Sign.Ac.Uk ”). \nThrough 11 items, the SIGN checklist evaluates internal \nvalidity and study quality. Additionally, the PEDro scale was \nassessed for each study (Appendix S2) (“PEDro Scale for \nRandomized Controlled Trials; Available Online: https://\nPedro.Org.Au/”). The methodological quality of the articles \nwas evaluated by two independent reviewers.\nStatistical considerations\nData were analyzed using Stata (version 16, TX, USA). \nWhen not available, standard deviation (SD) was calculated \nby multiplying the standard error of the mean (SEM) by \nthe square root of the sample size (Lee, In, and Lee 2015) \nor estimated from interval quartiles or minimum and max-\nimum intervals (Wan et  al. 2014). The main meta-analysis \ncompared changes in VO 2max between groups (CS versus \nplacebo). Changes were calculated using the method from \nBorenstein et  al. ( 2009). Results were expressed as effect \nsize (ES) (DerSimonian and Laird 1986). A decreased ES \ndenoted a lower improvement in VO 2max in the CS com-\npared to the placebo group. A scale for ES has been sug-\ngested with −0.2 reflecting a small effect, −0.5 a moderate \neffect, and −0.8 a large effect (Cohen 1988). In order to \nverify the strength of our results, we also computed \nrandom-effects meta-analysis on VO 2max (1) at baseline \nbetween groups (CS versus placebo) to verify that groups \nwere comparable, (2) within groups after supplementation, \n(3) as well as after supplementation between groups. Each \nmeta-analysis was stratified by type of exercise (running, \nFigure 2. Quality of articles – siGn checklist.\n\n4 D. GRAS eT AL.\ncycling, or rowing) and units of measurement (L/min or \nmL/kg/min). For studies that reported VO 2max in both units \n(L/min and mL/kg/min) simultaneously, we computed \nmeta-analyses including both units (where the weight of \nstudies would need ponderation), and sensitivity analyses, \ni.e., meta-analyses using only data in L/min or mL/kg/min \nwhen both units were available within the same study. \nFinally, we also conducted meta-analyses on the ventilatory \nthreshold, maximal power output, and time to exhaustion \non the incremental exercise tests. For all aforementioned \nmeta-analyses, sensitivity analyses were conducted after \nexcluding studies outside funnel plots and on young and \nhealthy individuals. Heterogeneity between studies was also \nevaluated using I 2 statistic, ranging from 0 (no heterogene-\nity) to 100% (high heterogeneity). Meta-regressions were \ncomputed to search for putative influential factors of \nVO2max, such as characteristics of the population (age, gen -\nder, training, and health), characteristics of supplementation \n(loading dose, total duration of supplementation, and total \ndose), and characteristics of training during supplementation \n(none, aerobic, or anaerobic). Results were expressed as \nregression coefficients and 95%CI. P -values less than 0.05 \nwere considered statistically significant.\nResults\nAn initial search produced a possible 4985 articles. Removal \nof duplicates and use of the selection criteria reduced the \nnumber of articles reporting VO 2max assessment at baseline \nand following CS or placebo in nineteen articles. Among \nthem, one study reported two independent gender groups \n(Smith et  al. 2011). All articles were written in English \n(Figure 1).\nQuality of articles\nThe risk of bias in included studies was mostly low \n(Figure 2 and Appendix S2). However, most studies did not \ndescribe the randomization method. Some studies matched \nparticipants based on the baseline measurements. Two stud-\nies used a single-blind design (Reardon et  al. 2006; Canete \net  al. 2006), but all participants were blinded to supplemen-\ntation. Three studies declared a dropout of more than twenty \npercent (Nelson et  al. 2000; Reardon et  al. 2006; Kuethe \net  al. 2006). All studies mentioned ethical approval.\nStudy designs and aims of included articles\nAll studies were double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled \ntrials. Only one study had a cross-over design (Kuethe \net  al. 2006). All the studies were monocentric. Five studies \nwere conducted in Europe (Germany (Kuethe et  al. 2006), \nNetherlands (Van Loon et  al. 2003; Bert O. Eijnde et  al. \n2003), Poland (Sterkowicz et  al. 2012) and Sweden (Balsom \net  al. 1993)), one in Brazil (Carvalho et  al. 2012; Lázaro \nda Silveira et  al. 2014), eight in North America (Canada \n(Forbes et  al. 2017) and USA (Graef et  al. 2009; Hickner \net  al. 2010; Kresta et  al. 2014; Nelson et  al. 2000; Smith \net  al. 2011; Canete et  al. 2006; Villanueva, He, and \nSchroeder 2014)), and four in Australia (Barnett, Hinds, \nand Jenkins 1996; Lawrence et  al. 1997; Murphy et  al. \n2005; Reardon et  al. 2006). The duration between baseline \nand after supplementation ranged from 4 (Barnett, Hinds, \nand Jenkins 1996) to 180 days (Carvalho et  al. 2012). The \nnineteen included studies aimed to evaluate the effect of \nCS on performance or quality of life in elderly and patients \nwith heart failure (Canete et  al. 2006 ; Carvalho et  al. 2012 ; \nKuethe et  al. 2006; Villanueva, He, and Schroeder 2014), \namong which nine studies aimed specifically at assessing \naerobic performance (Balsom et  al. 1993; Nelson et  al. \n2000; Murphy et  al. 2005; Hickner et  al. 2010; Smith et  al. \n2011; Reardon et  al. 2006; Forbes et  al. 2017; Graef et  al. \n2009; Lawrence et  al. 1997). Seventeen studies recruited \nhealthy individuals, while two studies recruited patients \nwith heart failure (Carvalho et  al. 2012; Kuethe et  al. 2006) \n(Table 1).\nPopulation\nThe sample size ranged from 10 (Sterkowicz et  al. 2012) to \n46 (Eijnde et  al. 2003), for a total of 424 participants (216 \nin the CS and 208 in the placebo group).\nGender was reported in all studies. The mean proportion \nof males was 81.7%, with 160 males and 56 females in the \nCS group versus 155 males and 53 females in the placebo \ngroup. Eleven studies included only males (Balsom et  al. \n1993; Barnett, Hinds, and Jenkins 1996; Lázaro da Silveira \net  al. 2014; Graef et  al. 2009; Hickner et  al. 2010; Murphy \net al. 2005; Van Loon et al. 2003; Eijnde et al. 2003; Carvalho \net  al. 2012; Villanueva, He, and Schroeder 2014) and three \nonly females (Canete et  al. 2006; Forbes et  al. 2017; Kresta \net  al. 2014).\nAge was reported as the mean value in all studies except \nfor three studies that reported age in the min-max interval \n(Balsom et  al. 1993; Lázaro da Silveira et  al. 2014; Reardon \net  al. 2006). The mean age was 29.7 years old, ranging from \n20.5 (Barnett, Hinds, and Jenkins 1996) to 68 (Canete et  al. \n2006). Most studies (79%) had participants aged between \n18 and 40 years old.\nPhysical activity at baseline was reported in all studies. \nWe classified individuals as competitive or highly trained \nathletes (15.6%) (Sterkowicz et  al. 2012; Balsom et  al. 1993; \nLázaro da Silveira et  al. 2014; Lawrence et  al. 1997), rec-\nreationally trained (54.2%) (Barnett, Hinds, and Jenkins \n1996; Forbes et  al. 2017; Graef et  al. 2009; Hickner et  al. \n2010; Kresta et  al. 2014; Murphy et  al. 2005; Nelson et  al. \n2000; Reardon et  al. 2006; Smith et  al. 2011; Villanueva, \nHe, and Schroeder 2014), and sedentary or have low daily \nphysical activity (30.2%) (Van Loon et  al. 2003; Bert O. \nEijnde et  al. 2003; Canete et  al. 2006; Kuethe et  al. 2006; \nCarvalho et  al. 2012).\nAdditional outcomes were seldomly reported, such as \nechocardiographic measures (Murphy et  al. 2005; Kuethe \net  al. 2006) or cellular changes using muscular biopsy \n(Hickner et  al. 2010; Reardon et  al. 2006; Van Loon et  al. \n2003; Eijnde et  al. 2003 ; Kresta et  al. 2014) ( Table 1).

We used VO 2max as a gener -\nalization in this study. Nine studies measured VO 2max in \nL/min (Nelson et  al. 2000; Murphy et  al. 2005; Hickner et  al. \n2010; Van Loon et  al. 2003; Eijnde et  al. 2003; Forbes et  al. \n2017; Graef et  al. 2009; Barnett, Hinds, and Jenkins 1996; \nLawrence et  al. 1997 ) and eleven in mL/kg/min (Balsom \net  al. 1993; Canete et  al. 2006; Carvalho et  al. 2012; Smith \net al. 2011; Reardon et al. 2006; Kuethe et al. 2006; Sterkowicz \net  al. 2012; Lázaro da Silveira et  al. 2014; Forbes et  al. 2017; \nKresta et  al. 2014; Villanueva, He, and Schroeder 2014). \nAmong them, one study reported both L/min and mL/kg/\nmin (Forbes et  al. 2017). Most studies measured VO 2max \nwith gas exchange analysis during incremental exercise tests \nsuch as the bicycle ergometer test (Barnett, Hinds, and \nJenkins 1996; Forbes et  al. 2017; Graef et  al. 2009; Hickner \net  al. 2010; Kresta et  al. 2014; Murphy et  al. 2005; Nelson \net  al. 2000; Reardon et  al. 2006 ; Van Loon et  al. 2003 ; Eijnde \net  al. 2003; Canete et  al. 2006; Carvalho et  al. 2012), tread-\nmill test (Balsom et  al. 1993; Smith et  al. 2011; Sterkowicz \net  al. 2012; Kuethe et  al. 2006; Villanueva, He, and Schroeder \n2014), or rowing ergometer test (Lawrence et  al. 1997). The \nincremental tests were as close as possible to the training \nhabitus of participants. VO 2max was also extrapolated from \nsub-maximal measures of VO 2max in two studies (Ebbeling \net  al. 1991; Villanueva, He, and Schroeder 2014) and esti-\nmated through a 12-minute Cooper test in one study (Lázaro \nda Silveira et  al. 2014). Ten studies also assessed ventilatory \nthreshold, using the V-slope method (Beaver, Wasserman, \nand Whipp 1986) in six studies (Forbes et  al. 2017; Graef \net  al. 2009; Nelson et  al. 2000; Kuethe et  al. 2006; Bert O. \nEijnde et  al. 2003; Carvalho et  al. 2012) – that is, the point \nwhere VCO2 production increases more than VO 2 consump-\ntion –, the “Wasserman” method (Wasserman et  al. 1973) \nin three studies (Canete et  al. 2006; Kresta et  al. 2014; Smith \net  al. 2011) – that is, the point where VE/VO 2 increases \nwithout a concomitant increase in VE/VCO 2, and without \nfurther information in one study (Sterkowicz et  al. 2012). \nSix studies reported time to exhaustion (Smith et  al. 2011; \nGraef et  al. 2009; Kresta et  al. 2014; Murphy et  al. 2005) or \nmaximal power output (Van Loon et  al. 2003; Eijnde et  al. \n2003; Canete et  al. 2006) at the incremental tests (Table 1 \nand Appendix S3).\nCreatine supplementation\nCr monohydrate was used in 74% of studies, Cr citrate in \ntwo studies (Graef et  al. 2009 ; Smith et  al. 2011 ), Cr malate \nin one study (Sterkowicz et  al. 2012), and not reported in \ntwo studies (Carvalho et  al. 2012; Kuethe et  al. 2006). A \nloading dose was used in twelve studies, that is, a dose ≥ \n20 g/day or 0.3 g/kg, which had shown the greatest effec-\ntiveness for increasing muscle total Cr content with minimal \nCr losses through renal excretion (Harris, Söderlund, and \nHultman 1992), split in two (Forbes et  al. 2017), three \n(Canete et  al. 2006; Lázaro da Silveira et  al. 2014; Villanueva, \nHe, and Schroeder 2014) or four (Nelson et al. 2000; Murphy \net  al. 2005; Smith et  al. 2011; Reardon et  al. 2006; Kuethe \net  al. 2006; Van Loon et  al. 2003; Kresta et  al. 2014; \nLawrence et  al. 1997) intakes per day, during 4–7 days for \nall studies except one that used a loading dose for a pro-\nlonged period (Kuethe et  al. 2006). A maintenance dose \nranging from 2 (Murphy et  al. 2005) to 10 g/day (Murphy \net  al. 2005) was used in six studies, once-daily except for \none study (Murphy et  al. 2005). Seven studies did not use \na loading dose and supplemented only with a low dose of \nCr (Balsom et  al. 1993; Hickner et  al. 2010; Carvalho et  al. \n2012; Eijnde et  al. 2003; Sterkowicz et  al. 2012; Graef et  al. \n2009; Barnett, Hinds, and Jenkins 1996). In total, the CS \nwas 285 g on average, ranging from 42 g (Barnett, Hinds, \nand Jenkins 1996) to 912 g (Eijnde et  al. 2003), over 42 days, \nranging from four days (Barnett, Hinds, and Jenkins 1996) \nto six months (Eijnde et  al. 2003) (Table 1).\nTraining during supplementation\nAll participants performed the same physical training in \nall studies and differed only by supplementation (Cr or \nplacebo). A standardized training program was proposed \nin six studies: high-intensity interval training (HIIT) \n(Graef et  al. 2009; Forbes et  al. 2017), resistance \n(Villanueva, He, and Schroeder 2014), aerobic (Reardon \net  al. 2006), or mixed training (Eijnde et  al. 2003; Lázaro \nda Silveira et  al. 2014). Nine studies maintained the usual \nphysical activity of participants, i.e., running (Balsom \net  al. 1993), cycling (Hickner et  al. 2010), rowing \n(Lawrence et  al. 1997), team sports (Murphy et  al. 2005), \njudo (Sterkowicz et  al. 2012) or other recreational activ-\nities (Nelson et  al. 2000; Smith et  al. 2011; Kresta et  al. \n2014; Barnett, Hinds, and Jenkins 1996). Four studies \nincluded sedentary participants without exercise interven-\ntion (Van Loon et  al. 2003; Canete et  al. 2006; Kuethe \net  al. 2006; Carvalho et  al. 2012). We classified exercise \ntraining as “aerobic” (68.9%), “anaerobic” (11.8%) or \n“none” (19.3%) (Table 1).\nMeta-analysis\nConsidering all measures of VO2max, there were no differences \nin any outcomes at baseline between-group CS and placebo \ngroups (Appendix S4). Using changes from baseline to after \nthe supplementation, VO2max increased less in the CS group \n\nCRiTiCAL ReviewS in FOOD SCienCe AnD nUTRiTiOn 7\nthan the control group (ES = −0.30, 95%CI = −0.50 to −0.11, \np = 0.003). Stratification showed a lower increase in the CS \ngroup for VO 2max in L/min (ES= −0.39, 95%CI = −0.67 to \n−0.12, p = 0.005), and for cycling (ES= −0.33, 95%CI = −0.58 \nto −0.09, p = 0.007). Other aerobic outcomes (ventilatory thresh-\nold, time to exhaustion, maximal power output) did not differ \nbetween groups (Figure 3). Considering all measures of VO2max \nand only VO2max expressed in L/min for the single study that \nreported both units (Forbes et  al. 2017), sensitivity analyses \nshowed similar findings, that is, a lower increase in VO 2max \nin the CS compared with the control group (ES = −0.32, 95%CI \n= −0.52 to −0.11, p = 0.002) (Appendix S3 ). Results were nearly \nidentical with VO2max expressed in mL/kg/min.\nOther sensitivity analyses\nMeta-analyses comparing VO 2max after CS between groups \ndemonstrated similar results than meta-analyses on \nchanges, that is, a significant lower VO 2max in the CS \ncompared with the placebo group (ES= −0.20, 95%CI = \n−0.39 to −0.001, p = 0.049), as well as for VO 2max \nexpressed in L/min (ES= −0.32, 95%CI = −0.59 to −0.04, \np = 0.022), and a tendency for cycling (ES= −0.22, 95%CI \n= −0.46 to 0.02, p = 0.074) (Appendix S4). We also com-\nputed meta-analyses on VO 2max changes within groups \nshowing that VO 2max increased in the placebo group (ES= \n0.35, 95%CI = 0.15–0.54, p = 0.001), with only a tendency \nwithin the CS group (ES= 0.18, 95%CI = −0.01 to 0.37, \np = 0.060). Despite a very limited number of studies ( n = 3) \nfor this parameter, maximal power output increased in \nthe CS group (ES= 0.45, 95%CI = 0.03–0.88, p = 0.038). \nAll aforementioned meta-analyses were repeated after \nexcluding studies not evenly distributed around the base \nof the meta-funnel (Figure 4), and demonstrated similar \nfindings ( Appendix S5 ). Lastly, we also repeated all \nmeta-analyses in the subgroup of young and healthy par -\nticipants, and results were similar, that is, a lower VO 2max \nincrease in the CS compared to the placebo group using \nFigure 3. Meta-analysis of aerobic changes after supplementation period between groups.\n\n8 D. GRAS eT AL.\nchanges between groups (ES= −0.26, 95%CI = −0.49 to \n−0.02, p = 0.031), a lower VO 2max after CS in the CS \ncompared to the placebo group (ES = −0.26, −95%CI = \n0.49 to −0.02, p = 0.031), an increase in VO 2max within \nthe placebo group (ES = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.02–0.48, \np = 0.035) and not within the CS group (ES = 0.10, 95% \nCI = −0.13 to 0.32, p = 0.41). Using changes between \ngroups, the ventilatory threshold increased in the CS com-\npared to the control group (ES = 0.66, 95%CI = 0.23–1.1, \np = 0.003) (Figure 3 and Appendix S6).\nMeta-regressions\nThe meta-regressions failed to show any influencing vari-\nables on the VO 2max, that is, the putative influence of \nindividuals, supplementation, or training characteristics. The \nadverse effect of CS on VO 2max was not linked to body \nmass or changes in body mass, which did not significantly \nvary in both groups. The limited number of patients with \nheart failure precluded analyses on the influence of health \nstatus on VO 2max (Figure 5).",
    "discussion": "The main findings were that CS is detrimental to VO 2max, \nespecially for cycling. If CS was also not beneficial on the \nmaximal aerobic parameters associated with VO 2max, the \nventilatory threshold seemed to be improved. Results were \nindependent of sociodemographic or supplementation \ncharacteristics.\nCr is well-known for its ergogenic effects in acute \nhigh-intensity exercises. However, current results of our \nFigure 5. Meta-regressions for the main outcome ( vo2max).\nFigure 4. Funnel plots of aerobic changes after supplementation period \nbetween groups.\n\nCRiTiCAL ReviewS in FOOD SCienCe AnD nUTRiTiOn 9\nmeta-analysis led to adverse effects of CS on endurance \ncapacity assessed with VO 2max, which increased in the pla-\ncebo but not in the CS group. VO 2max limiting factors are \nshared between central factors for ∼ 70% and peripheral \nfactors for ∼ 30% (di Prampero and Ferretti 1990). Thus, O 2 \ndelivery and particularly maximal cardiac output are the \nprimary limiting factors of VO 2max during exercise (Bassett \n2000). Cr is known to induce water retention in tissues such \nas skeletal muscle (Casey et  al. 1996) and, potentially, car -\ndiomyocytes (Ipsiroglu et  al. 2001). However, its cardiomy-\nocytes’ effects on contractile function and blood flow during \nexercise are lacking and still questionable. In addition to \nthe cardiac function, O 2 delivery to working muscles also \ndepends on arterial oxygen content. Even if hemoglobin \nlevels are not modified following CS (Preen et  al. 2001; \nHickner et  al. 2010; Robinson et  al. 2000), CS can alter \nplasma volume during exercise (Hickner et  al. 2010) effects \non muscle oxygen supply and VO 2max were not fully \ndemonstrated. Finally, the effects of CS on central limiting \nfactors of VO 2max do not appear to be essential. This can \nbe explained by the fact that CS rather acts at the peripheral \nmuscle level. Since CS is well-known to improve anaerobic \nperformance through muscle hypertrophy and the higher \nrecruitment in fast-twitch muscle fibers (Casey et  al. 1996), \nchanges in skeletal muscle energy metabolism could have \nexplained our negative findings on VO 2max. This hypothesis \nis supported by the lack of improvement in muscle oxidative \ncapacity following CS (Van Loon et  al. 2003; Thompson \net  al. 1996). The negative effect of CS on VO 2max should \nbe considered, especially in endurance athletes for whom \nVO2max is a determining factor of performance.\nThe ventilatory threshold refers to the point during exer -\ncise at which ventilation starts to increase at a faster rate \nthan VO 2 related to the onset of lactate accumulation \n(Wasserman et  al. 1973). The ventilatory threshold occurs \nat a higher percentage of VO 2max in well-trained endurance \nathletes (Ivy et  al. 1980) and can predict endurance per -\nformance, regardless of the level of training (Bassett 2000; \nReybrouck et  al. 1986). The increase in the ventilatory \nthreshold found after CS in the young and healthy follows \ngreater exercise efficiency at submaximal workloads, result-\ning in decreased O 2 consumption (Nelson et  al. 2000; \nMurphy et  al. 2005; Hickner et  al. 2010). Hypotheses are \nthat CrP hydrolysis consumes hydrogen ions and might \ncontribute to the buffering of intracellular acidosis when \nATP resynthesis occurs from CrP stores (Mesa et  al. 2002). \nMoreover, increased muscle CrP levels due to CS could \ndelay the decrease in the ATP/ADP ratio needed to stim-\nulate mitochondrial respiration and VO 2 (Nelson et al. \n2000). An increase in mechanical efficiency could also par -\nticipate (Nelson et  al. 2000; Da Silva Azevedo et  al. 2019). \nMitochondrial changes following CS at a cellular level are \nyet to be explored. The effects of age in ventilatory thresh-\nold improvement remain unclear (Thomas et  al. 1985). \nDespite being poorly studied, maximal aerobic power output \ndid not change following CS in our meta-analysis (Canete \net  al. 2006; Van Loon et  al. 2003; Eijnde et  al. 2003), in \ncoherence with the fact that CS rather acts on fast-twitch \nmuscle fibers (Hill and Rowell 1996). There was no change \nin time to exhaustion, but an incremental exercise test \ntargets to reach VO 2max in a limited time, and therefore \nthis parameter is mainly dependent on the incremental \nprotocol.\nWe showed that CS limited more VO 2max in cycling \nthan in running or rowing, but it may be biased considering \nthe greatest number of participants performing cycling. \nWhile HIIT partly involves anaerobic capacities and shows \ninteresting results on VO 2max in the literature (Tabata et  al. \n1996), the lack of data for HIIT in our meta-analyses did \nnot permit to retrieval of an influence of HIIT on VO 2max \nwhen associated with CS (Forbes et  al. 2017; Graef et  al. \n2009). We also failed to demonstrate any relationships \nbetween volume and intensity of training on the negative \neffects of CS on VO 2max, despite abundant dose-response \nliterature in anaerobic performance (Lanhers et  al. 2015 and \n2017). Regarding characteristics of supplementation, Cr \nmonohydrate was mainly used, precluding further compar -\nisons between Cr forms. Improvement in VO 2max is altered \nwith CS regardless of the doses. We failed to demonstrate \na dose-response relationship, even though CS varied from \n4 days to 6 months. Even if optimal doses to increase muscle \ntotal Cr content with minimal renal Cr losses (Harris, \nSöderlund, and Hultman 1992), favoring anaerobic perfor -\nmances, mitochondrial changes following CS at a cellular \nlevel are yet to be explored. CS has been most extensively \nstudied in young and trained males.\nInterestingly, some studies also explored the putative ben-\nefits of CS in specific populations, such as in the elderly \nand patients with heart failure. In those populations, CS \ndid not improve VO 2max, regardless of the type of physical \nactivity (Canete et  al. 2006; Eijnde et  al. 2003; Villanueva, \nHe, and Schroeder 2014), which seem coherent because the \ncentral limitation appears even more predominant than in \nyoung athletes. However, it should be noted that CS is \nknown to benefit the elderly, such as improving muscular \nstrength and functional performance (Kuethe et  al. 2006)\n(Devries and Phillips 2014). Lastly, even if strength gains \nwere reported to be greater in males (McNaughton, et al. \n1998; Tyka et  al. 2015), we did not find sex-based differ -\nences on VO 2max changes with CS, following one study \nthat included gender comparisons (Smith et  al. 2011).\nThis is the first meta-analysis that has focused on the \neffect of CS on VO 2max. Many studies did not report and \nincluded all their results in the meta-analysis. For instance, \nstudies reported baseline measurement without measurement \nafter supplementation for VO 2max or without its change \nexpression (Nelson et  al. 2000; McNaughton, Dalton, and \nTarr 1998) or did not express dispersion of its measurement \n(Tyka et  al. 2015). Our study has some limitations inherited \nfrom all meta-analyses (LeLorier et  al. 1997), but the use \nof rigorous inclusion criteria, that is, double-blind RCTs \nlimited the publication bias. Reporting bias due to the scar -\ncity of publications with negative findings is common to all \nsystematic reviews and meta-analyses. However, it could \nhave reinforced our main findings. A publication bias was \nalso assessed according to funnel plots, and sensitivity anal-\nyses showed similar results on the main outcome. \nMeasurements of VO 2max varied among studies, which \n\n10 D. GRAS eT AL.\ncould have led to a measurement bias. The rigorous deter -\nmination of VO 2max depends on different criteria (plateau \nin oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange ratio > 1,1, \nheart rate greater than age-predicted maximal heart rate, \nblood lactates > 6–8 mmol or physical exhaustion (Lacour \nand Flandrois 1977)). In our meta-analysis, VO 2max was \nreported through rigorous determination by three studies \n(Hickner et  al. 2010; Murphy et  al. 2005; Smith et  al. 2011). \nFour studies (Nelson et  al. 2000; Canete et  al. 2006; Forbes \net  al. 2017; Graef et  al. 2009) assessed VO 2peak as the \nhighest average VO2 obtained for any period of time between \n15-sec (Graef et  al. 2009) and 1-min (Canete et  al. 2006) \nwithout specifying if a VO 2plateau was obtained. Ten studies \ndid not provide additional information for the determination \nof the maximum oxygen uptake and mentioned VO 2max \n(Balsom et  al. 1993; Van Loon et  al. 2003) or VO 2peak \n(Carvalho et  al. 2012; Reardon et  al. 2006; Kuethe et  al. \n2006; Eijnde et  al. 2003 ; Sterkowicz et  al. 2012 ; Kresta et  al. \n2014; Barnett, Hinds, and Jenkins 1996; Lawrence et  al. \n1997) without precision, and two studies estimated VO 2max \n(Lázaro da Silveira et  al. 2014; Villanueva, He, and Schroeder \n2014). To assess the impact of training associated with CS, \nwe used a classification that may have generated a bias. \nMost of the performance variables included in this \nmeta-analysis were measured in a laboratory setting, and \nfield-based endurance performance also must be assessed.",
    "conclusion": "and practical implications\nOur analysis showed the negative effects of CS on VO 2max, regardless \nof the supplementation protocols, physical training, and population \ncharacteristics.
