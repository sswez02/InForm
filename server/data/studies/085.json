    "introduction": "Aging is the age-related decline of biological functions [1]. Aging \nis a natural process associated with modifications in biological \nsystems such as a decline in muscle mass and muscle strength [2]. \nSkeletal muscle accounts for approximately 40% of total body \nmass, and it plays an indispensable role in locomotion and me -\ntabolism [3, 4]. Between the ages of 20 and 80, humans \nlose approximately 20–30% of their skeletal muscle mass. Skel -\netal muscle undergoes a gradual loss of fat-free mass, size, and \nfunction in the aging process called sarcopenia [2]. Several pos -\nsible mechanisms for age-related muscle atrophy have been de -\nscribed; however, the precise contribution of each is not well known. \nAge-related muscle loss is a result of reductions in the size and \nnumber of muscle fibres, possibly due to a multifactorial process \nthat involves physical activity, nutritional intake, oxidative stress, \nand hormones or signalling molecules [5]. It has been suggested \nthat elevations in circulating concentrations of cell-signalling mol -\necules increase the likelihood of receptor interaction and thus \nEffects of soy milk ingestion immediately after resistance training \non muscular-related biomarkers in older men: a randomized \ncontrolled trial\nAUTHORS: Babak Hooshmand-Moghadam1, Monika Johne2, Fateme Golestani3, Katarzyna Lorenz2, \nMonireh Asadi4, Ewelina Maculewicz2, Andrzej Mastalerz2\n1 Department of Exercise Physiology, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran\n2 Department of Biomedical Sciences, Józef Piłsudski University of Physical Education, Warsaw, Poland\n3 Department of Exercise Physiology, University of Birjand, Birjand, Iran\n4 Faculty of Sports Sciences, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran",

All of these criteria \nwere assessed by the physician using the Physical Activity Readiness \nQuestionnaire (PAR-Q) and the Health/Medical History Questionnaire. \nWritten informed consent was obtained from all participants. All \nexperiments were performed in accordance with the Declaration of \nHelsinki. This study has been approved by the Sport Sciences Re-\nsearch Institute of Iran (IR.SSRC.REC.1398.062) and registered in \nthe Iranian Clinical Trials Registry (IRCT20190731044398N3).\nStudy design\nThis study was a randomized, double-blind, parallel prospective \nclinical trial (Figure 2). Prior to baseline measurements, all participants \nwere familiarized with all tests and procedures. The participants were \nthen randomized to two groups: soy milk + resistance training (SR; \nn = 15) or placebo + resistance training (PR; n = 15). The alloca-\ntion was stratified using a digital tool available at www.randomizer.\norg. Measurements were collected at the beginning and end of the \n12 weeks of intervention. All measurements were recorded at the \nsame time and under the same environmental conditions. Participants \nwere asked not to change their current lifestyle and eating habits \nduring the study period.\nInterventions\nSupplementation protocol\nParticipants in the SR group received 240 ml of vanilla-flavoured \ndairy-free soy milk immediately after each training session and si -\nmultaneously on non-training days for 12 weeks. Also, participants \nin the PR group received 240 ml of placebo (a placebo with artifi-\ncially sweetened water) at the same time as the SR group. Soy milk \nand placebo were in opaque (masked) beverage containers and were \nsimilar in taste and smell, texture and appearance [31]. The timing \nand dose of soy milk were chosen according to the previous studies \nconducted by other scientists [30, 32]. Soy milk (dairy-, lactose-, \nand casein-free; absolutely no carrageenan, gluten, egg, or peanut) \nwas supplied from Saina Ghaza Part Company, Iran and registered \nwith the health ministry (No:56/16554). The energy and macronu-\ntrient composition of this milk per 240 mL are as follows: energy, \n99.6 kcal; protein, 6.75 g; carbohydrate, 9.15 g; fat, 4 g; calcium, \n100 mg; sodium, 98 mg; cholesterol, 0 mg; iron, 1.1 mg; vitamin \nD 2.5 mcg; vitamin A, 150 mcg; vitamin B12, 1.5 mcg; potassium, \n300 mg; riboflavin 0.4 mg. It should be noted that researchers \nmonitored the soy milk supplementation. After the training sessions, \nsoy milk was served to the participants by the researcher, who wit-\nnessed its consumption. On non-training days, supplementation was \nverified by phone or SMS. To assess compliance with supplementa-\ntion on non-training days, participants provided empty nutrient \nboxes to study staff.\nand therefore it is potentially involved in sarcopenia [8, 10]. Base-\nline GDF-15 predicts declining physical activity in the elderly [11]. \nIrisin is a novel myokine that has been shown to induce browning \nof white adipocytes. Irisin improves myogenesis and induces hyper-\ntrophy of skeletal muscle since it is secreted from muscles in re -\nsponse to exercise [12, 13]. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) \nas a protein is produced in the skeletal muscle and increased by \nmuscle contraction to enhance fat oxidation, which can regulate glu-\ncose and fat metabolism [14]. Lower concentrations of BDNF and \nirisin, and higher concentrations of activin A, growth and differenti-\nation factor-15 (GDF15), and tumour growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) have \nbeen reported during aging [15–18].\nResistance training improves musculoskeletal strength, muscle \nmass, bone mass, and connective tissue thickness [19]. Previous re-\nsearch has shown that strength training increases power and strength, \nmuscle size, and plasma-metabolism biomarkers in the elder -\nly [2, 15, 20–22]. Resistance training is a potent stimulus to increase \nskeletal muscle mass and",
    "results": "in an anabolic response [23]. The \nmuscle protein accretion process depends on a robust synergistic ac-\ntion between protein intake and overload [23]. It is suggested that \npost-exercise protein ingestion increases plasma amino acids, which \nresults in the activation of signalling molecules, leading to an increase \nof MPS and muscle hypertrophy, particularly leucine, thus activating \nthe key anabolic signalling mechanism of the mechanistic target of \nrapamycin (mTOR) [23–25]. The balance between MPS and MPB is \ndependent on protein consumption and the accompanying hyperam-\ninoacidaemia, which stimulates a marked rise in MPS and mild sup-\npression of MPB [26]. Recently, it was suggested that soy milk (a plant-\nbased non-dairy beverage) can be considered to be a nutritionally \nadequate and complete protein, which is enriched in fatty acids, phos-\nphatidylcholine, and isoflavones, particularly genistein [27]. Soy milk \nis a good source of protein, calcium, and potassium [28]. Also, it has \nbeen reported that soy milk contains essential amino acids such as \nleucine, lysine, phenylalanine, and isoleucine [29, 30]. Based on the \nauthors’ knowledge, the present study is the first one to evaluate the \neffects of soy milk consumption and resistance training on serum con-\ncentrations of activin, GDF15, TGFβ1, BDNF , and irisin in older men. \nHowever, there have been limited studies with contradictory findings \nthat have been conducted to examine the effects of soy milk consump-\ntion and resistance training on body composition, strength, and pow-\ner. Therefore, we conducted the present study to assess the effects of \nsoy milk ingestion on changes in body composition, strength, power, \nand muscular-related biomarkers (activin A, GDF15, TGFβ1, BDNF , \nand irisin) following 12 weeks of resistance training in older men.",

The resistance training (four sets/six exercis-\nes/15 tempo-controlled repetitions/30-second rest between each \nexercise) included leg presses, chest presses, rows, leg stretches, \npull-ups, and triceps push-ups. Participants began training at ~60% \nof one repetition maximum (1RM) at the beginning of the intervention; \nif they could comfortably do the exercise for about 60 seconds, we \nadded about 5% weight gain for the next training session. 1RM was \ndetermined as described by Calvani et al. [33]. The periodized proto-\ncols were adapted from previous studies [34]. All training sessions \nwere supervised by qualified personal trainers.\nMeasurements\nBody composition assessments\nUpon arrival at the laboratory, participants were asked to urinate \ncompletely within 30 minutes of the test. Body weight (BM) was \nmeasured using a digital scale (SECA, Germany) with an accuracy \nof 0.1 kg. The height of the participant was measured with a stadi-\nometer (SECA, Germany) with an accuracy of 0.1 cm. Also, body fat \npercentage (BFP), body mass index (BMI), and muscle mass were \nassessed using a multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance device \n(BIA; Jawon Medical X Contact-356, South Korea), as previously \ndescribed [35]. The test-retest reliability of the bioelectrical imped-\nance method is high (R = 0.95 to 0.99) [36].\nExercise training programme\nIn order to familiarize themselves with the training procedures, the \nmembers of the two groups were familiarized with the correct form \nof lifting and correct breathing techniques.

A med-\nical doctor supervised the Wingate testing to monitor signs of car -\ndiovascular discomfort. VO2max of each participant was measured by \nthe modified Bruce protocol as described by Bamman et al. to de-\ntermine fitness level [37]. Also, the upper limb body strength (UBS) \nand lower limb body strength (LBS) of participants were evaluated \nby one-repetition maximum (1RM) on the chest press and leg press \nmachines, respectively, as previously described [34].\nBlood biochemistry\nFasting blood samples (~10 mL) were collected from the antecubi-\ntal vein using standard procedures approximately 48 h before and \nafter the last training session. Following the completion of blood \nsampling, the samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes, \nand serum was stored at -80°C until further analysis. Serum activin \nA (kit: Cusabio Co, sensitivity: 3.9 pg/ml), GDF15 (kit: Cusabio Co, \nsensitivity: 1.95 pg/ml), TGFβ1 (kit: Cusabio Co, sensitivity: 0.747 ng/\nml), BDNF (kit: Abcam Co, sensitivity: 2.4 pg/ml), and irisin (kit: \nCusabio Co, sensitivity: 0.78 ng/ml) concentrations were measured \nusing commercial human ELISA kits. The intra- and inter-assay coef-\nficients for all factors were < 8% and < 10%, respectively.\nNutrient intake and dietary analysis\nParticipants were asked to maintain their habitual diet during the \nstudy. To minimize dietary variability, participants submitted 3-day \n(2 weekdays and 1 weekend) food records at baseline and 12 weeks \nof the intervention. Each item of food was individually entered into \nDiet Analysis Plus version 10 (Cengage, Boston, MA, USA), and \ntotal energy consumption and the amount of energy derived from \nproteins, fats, and carbohydrates were evaluated [38].\nStatistical analysis\nEstimation of an appropriate sample size was conducted using the \nG*Power analysis software. Our rationale for sample size was based \non previous studies [30, 34]. The analysis revealed that a sample size \nof at least 26 participants (n = 13 per group) was needed to provide \npower (1- β) of 0.80 (α = 0.05). The normality of data distribution \nwas evaluated by the Shapiro–Wilk test. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) \nwas applied to examine the intra- and inter-group differences. In the \ncase of significant differences, a Fisher LSD post hoc test was used. \nNutrition data were analysed using repeated measures ANOVA anal-\nysis. Statistical significance was set at P ≤ 0.05. All statistical proce-\ndures were analysed using statistical package for social sciences IBM \nSPSS Statistics 22 (IBM Software Group, Chicago, IL, USA) and were \nexpressed as mean ± SD. All the figures were prepared in GraphPad \nPrism (version 8.0.2).\nRESULTS \nDietary intake monitoring and compliance with exercise training \nand supplementation interventions\nOverall adherence to both exercise training and supplementation was \n100% across PR and SR.

    "discussion": "This was the first randomized controlled clinical trial to examine the \neffects of soy milk ingestion during a resistance training programme \nin older men. The main findings of our study were that in both SR \nand PR groups, significantly increased muscle mass and strength, \nand serum concentrations of BDNF and irisin, and decreased BFP , \nserum concentrations of activin A, GDF15, and TGFβ1 were observed. \nThe results showed that soy milk ingestion (post-exercise) during \n12 weeks of resistance training increased muscle mass, muscle \nperformance (strength and power), and serum concentrations of \nirisin compared to a placebo; however, the same was not observed \nin serum concentrations of BDNF . Also, it was found that soy milk \ningestion (post-exercise) during 12 weeks of resistance training de-\ncreased serum concentrations of activin A and GDF15, compared to \na placebo; however, the same was not observed in serum concentra-\ntions of TGFβ1 and BFP . There were no adverse events reported from \neither nutritional intervention or the resistance training programme.\nThe significant gain in muscle mass and muscular strength from \nsoy milk ingestion compared to placebo in older men was in agree-\nment with the findings of the previous research. For instance, Chi-\nang et al. reported that soy milk (200 mL) during 12 weeks of mild \nresistance training significantly increased muscle mass and hand -\ngrip strength in very old nursing home residents with sarcopenia [39]. \nOrsatti et al. found that adding soy to milk combined with 16 weeks \nof resistance training resulted in a more significant gain in muscle \nmass and strength [40]. Nabuco et al. observed that 12 weeks of \nwhey protein (1 · 4 g/kg per day) along with resistance training led \nto a significant gain in muscle mass and strength and functional ca-\npacity in older women [3]. In addition, it was demonstrated that tak-\ning protein about 1 · 6 g/kg per day led to a significant gain in mus-\ncle mass and strength [41]. Resistance training stimulates rates of \nmuscle protein synthesis (MPS), which are further improved by the \npresence of dietary proteins [42]. Based on a meta-analysis by Mes-\nsina et al. [43], leucine, one of the three branched-chain amino ac-\nids, is able to stimulate the activation of MPS. In particular, leucine \nactivates MPS through the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1); therefore \nit prevents muscle atrophy during the aging process [43]. In the pres-\nent study, it may be possible that an increase of MPS led to \nη2 = 0.495) and muscle mass (F (1, 28) = 99.631, p < 0.001, \nη2 = 0.781) (Figure B and C; respectively).

Soy milk ingestion immediately after resistance training\nsignificant enhancement of muscular accretion and muscular strength \nduring the intervention. However, MPS was not evaluated in the pres-\nent study, but one of the possible reasons for an increase in muscle \nmass is MPS. Improvement of muscle mass and muscular strength \nafter soy milk ingestion and resistance training might be due to the \nmTORC1 signalling cascade, which integrates signals from mechan-\nical stimuli, growth factors, and nutrients to stimulate MPS. There-\nfore, the combination of soy milk and resistance training had bene-\nficial effects on elevating muscle mass and muscular strength.\nMuscle protein balance is also influenced by various hormones and \nmyokines, which have been suggested to alter the balance between \nanabolic and catabolic stimuli in muscle, leading to an increase or de-\ncrease in muscle mass. Among TGFβ isoforms, TGFβ1 is the most \nabundant and ubiquitously expressed isoform, which has a key role \nin various biological processes, including cell growth, muscle differ-\nentiation, apoptosis, tissue development, and inflammation [44]. \nTGFβ1 is a potent inhibitor of growth and differentiation in myoblasts \nand vascular smooth muscle cells; it also suppresses division and \nblocks fusion of satellite cells by suppressing myogenic factors [44]. \nIn addition, activin A and GDF-15, other members of the TGF-β fam-\nily, seem to have an inverse relationship with skeletal muscle growth \nand differentiation [45]. We found a significant reduction in serum \nconcentrations of TGFβ1, activin A, and GDF15 in both groups. How-\never, participants in the SR group experienced the most significant re-\nduction in serum concentrations of activin A and GDF15 compared \nwith the PR group. The mechanism of the effect of soy milk and re-\nsistance training on serum concentrations of activin A and GDF15 is \nstill unclear. Elevated expression of activins promotes muscle wasting \nand cachexia, whereas blocking of activin type II receptors protects \nskeletal muscle from atrophy and leads to strong hypertrophy [45]. \nChen et al. [46] reported that enhancement of circulating activin A not \nonly promoted the reduction of muscle mass and body weight in \na dose-dependent manner but also reduced muscle function, high-\nlighting the therapeutic potential of activin A inhibitors [46]. There-\nfore, it may have been expected that a significant reduction in serum \nconcentration of activin A and GDF15 in the SR group may be due to \na significant gain of muscle mass. In this regard, Bagheri et al. report-\ned a modest correlation between the changes in activin A and lean \nmass following post-exercise Icelandic yogurt consumption in healthy \nuntrained older men [42]. Soy milk ingestion during resistance train-\ning can control protein synthesis by intracellular signalling path -\nways [47]. Protein consumption made a positive balance, which led \nto the transfer of amino acids into the cell [31]. Potential mechanisms \nfor these changes are the synergy and interaction of soy milk and re-\nsistance training. Nevertheless, the superiority of the interaction of \nsoy milk supplementation and resistance training elucidates the im-\nprovement of skeletal muscle regulatory markers by suppressing ac-\ntivin A and GDF15 concentrations in skeletal muscle.\nAccording to the literature, skeletal muscle is increasingly classi-\nfied as an endocrine organ that can release a variety of signalling \nmolecules and regulate cytokines called myokines, such as irisin, \nwhich regulates several aging-related physiological and pathological \nprocesses [22]. Previous research showed a positive correlation be-\ntween concentrations of irisin and muscle mass gains in humans [22]. \nA recent study by Chang et al. [48] reported that a low blood con-\ncentration of irisin was a sensitive molecular marker for muscle weak-\nness and atrophy [48]. Huh et al. [49] reported a positive correla-\ntion between the decrease in serum irisin concentration and the loss \nof muscle mass associated with aging [49]. Kim et al. [50] stated \nthat there was a positive correlation between the changes in circu-\nlating level of irisin and the change of muscle mass following resis-\ntance training in obese adults [50]. The present study used 12 weeks \nof resistance training with soy milk supplementation, which led to \na significant rise in serum concentrations of irisin in the SR com -\npared to the PR group. These differences may be due to irisin re -\nsponsiveness to muscle mass gain [22], since it appears to be up-\nregulated in response to an increase in muscle mass, which was \nobserved in the soy milk ingestion group. Considering the benefits of \nsoy milk ingestion after resistance training in improving muscle \nstrength and function for the frail elderly, soy milk ingestion after re-\nsistance training could seem to be a beneficial intervention strategy \nto increase irisin concentrations in the aging population. A growing \nbody of studies has demonstrated that lower serum concentrations \nof BDNF are correlated with the aging process [51, 52]. The change \nin concentrations of BDNF with increasing age and neuronal loss in \nolder persons has been shown to be related to low peripheral BDNF \nlevels [51]. Our study indicated that both SR and PR groups expe-\nrienced similar and significant increases in serum concentrations of \nBDNF . These results are contradictory to the findings of Gomes et al., \nwho noted that serum concentrations of BDNF were increased in el-\nderly men after chronic exercise (12 weeks of aerobic training, con-\nsisting of a 50-min walk 3 times per week) [53]. Goekint et al. re-\nported an insignificant increase in serum concentrations of BDNF \nafter eight weeks of resistance training in untrained subjects [54]. \nTo the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first one to \nevaluate the effect of soy milk ingestion during resistance training on \ncirculating BDNF in elderly men. Our results suggest that resistance \ntraining interventions provide sufficient exercise stimulus to increase \nconcentrations of BDNF in elderly men. The effect of using soy milk \nin interaction with the resistance training programme was not prov-\nen, although the trend of BDNF change in the SR group was great-\ner than in the PR group (though not statistically significant).\nThe strengths of this study are triple. Firstly, the study design is \na randomized, controlled clinical trial. Secondly, we proved the ben-\nefits of soy milk ingestion and resistance training, and their direct ef-\nfects on muscular-related biomarkers as well as fitness and body \ncomposition markers in older men. Thirdly, valid and objective mea-\nsures were utilized for the evaluation of muscular-related biomark-\ners, body composition, and physical fitness. This study also had some \nlimitations. One of the limitations of this study was the lack of di -\netary intake monitoring, and therefore dietary intake was not care-\nfully controlled.
