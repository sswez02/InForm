    "introduction": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined\nobesity as “a condition in which there is an abnormal or\nexcessive accumulation of fat that can harm health”; obe-\nsity is a major cause of harm to the health [1]. The Or-\nganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\n(OECD)/WHO (2020) reported that in 2016, 39% of the\nmenand40%ofthewomen(approximately2billionadults)\naged 18 years and older worldwide were overweight, and\n11% of the men and 15% of the women (more than 500\nmillion adults) were obese. Both overweight status and\nobesity have significantly increased over the past 40 years\n(OECD/WHO, 2020). Globally, the prevalence of obesity\nhas increased by approximately 50%, from 8.7% in 2000\nto 13.1% in 2016. In 2016, the prevalence of obesity in\nmen was 11.1%, whereas, in women, it was 15.1%, which\nis approximately 35% higher in women (WHO, 2016). A\nsimilar trend has been reported in Korea, with the obesity\nprevalence increasing by approximately 20%, from 29.7%\nin2009to35.7%in2018[ 2].\nAs obesity is increasing worldwide, so are the risks\nof obesity-associated diseases and death, underscoring the\nimportance of weight management strategies [3–5]. Diet\ncontrol, exercise, drugs, and surgery have been the core of\nobesity management [6]. Exercise is an effective obesity\ntreatmentmethodbecauseitcanreducebodyweight(BW)\nby maximizing health benefits [6,7]. Exercise benefits in-\nclude maintaining normal BW, reducing body mass index\n(BMI),reducingvisceralfat, improvinginsulin sensitivity,\nimproving blood sugar, lowering blood pressure, improv-\ning blood lipid levels, as well as improving musculoskele-\ntalfunction,increasingleanbodymass,andimprovingim-\n\nmunefunction[ 8–10].\nExercise for obesity treatment and health promotion\ncanbedividedintoaerobicandresistanceexercises. Aero-\nbicexerciseisatraditionalmethodthatcanpromotefatloss\n[11], and resistance exercise is valued as an additional ap-\nproach for preserving lean and skeletal muscle mass [12].\nAs aerobic and resistance exercises have different effects\non weight management, many previous studies have com-\npared the effects of the two exercises [13–15]. Willis et\nal. [14]reportedthataerobicexercisesignificantlyreduced\nbodyfatmorethanresistanceexercise,whileresistanceex-\nercise significantly increased lean body mass. Yanget al.\n[15] conducted a meta-analysis of cardiovascular risk fac-\ntors. Bothaerobicandresistanceexercisesshowedpositive\neffects on increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol\n(HDL-C) and decreasing low-density lipoprotein choles-\nterol(LDL-C),totalcholesterol(TC),andtriglyceride(TG)\nlevels,butnosignificantdifferencewasfoundbetweenthe\nexercises. In a literature study published by Braith and\nStewart[13],aerobicexercisewasmoreeffectiveinreduc-\ningfatmass, andresistanceexercisewasmoreeffectivein\nincreasing lean body mass, but both exercises had similar\npositiveeffectsoncardiovascularriskfactors. Inobesein-\ndividuals,thesefindingsshowedthatresistanceexerciseis\nrelatively less effective in reducing body fat than aerobic\nexercise but is a useful exercise method that can improve\nleanbodymassandcardiovascularriskfactors.\nThe greatest benefit of resistance exercise is an in-\ncrease in lean body mass [16]. It has been reported that\npeoplewithlowleanbodymasshaveahighbody-fatratio,\nanincreasedriskofdiabetes,andahighmortalityrate[ 17].\nMuscle mass generally peaks in the late 30s and thereafter\ndeclines by approximately 0.37% and 0.47% annually in\nwomenandmen,respectively[ 18–20]. Lowmusclemassis\napredictorofcardiovascularmortalityriskandsignificantly\nincreasestheriskofall-causemortality[ 12,21]. Therefore,\nobesepeopleneedtomaintainappropriatemusclemassand\noptimal muscle strength levels through resistance exercise\ntoreducediseasemorbidityandmortality[ 22,23].\nRecently, hemorheological function, an index for\nblood circulation, component flow, and deformability, has\nreceivedmuchattentionasahealthindicatorrelatedtoobe-\nsity [24,25]. Hemorheological properties are factors that\nregulate blood flow from microvessels to tissues, and the\nrepresentativevariablesareredbloodcell(RBC)deforma-\nbilityandaggregation[ 26,27]. RBCdeformabilityandag-\ngregationarekeydeterminantsofvascularhealth,asRBCs\nmustbedeformedtopassthroughcapillariesthataremuch\nnarrower than RBCs to ensure sufficient blood flow in the\nmicrocirculation [26]. Obese people have lower RBC de-\nformabilityandhigherRBCaggregationthanhealthypeo-\nple [28], and those with obesity-related diseases, such as\ncardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, show reduced\nRBC deformability and increased RBC aggregation [29–\n31]. Exercisehasbeenreportedasarepresentativemethod\nfor improving hemorheological properties [32,33]. In par-\nticular,aerobicexercisehasbeenreportedtoimproveRBC\ndeformabilityandaggregationandtoinducelong-termim-\nprovement of the coronary microvascular system and vas-\ncular function, including resting blood pressure reduction\nand increase in peripheral blood flow [34–37]. However,\nthe effect of resistance exercise on hemorheological prop-\nertiesremainsunclear[ 38]. Althoughpreviousstudieshave\nreportedimprovementsinRBCdeformabilityandaggrega-\ntion according to acute resistance exercise [34], very few\nstudies have examined the hemorheological properties ac-\ncordingtolong-termresistancetraining. Theprevalenceof\nobesity is increasing worldwide, and it is increasing more\nin women than in men. Women have less muscle mass\nthanmen,andespeciallyinthecaseofmiddle-agedwomen,\nthe risk of obesity after menopause is much greater. Thus,\nobesewomenwereselectedasparticipants. Therefore,this\nstudyexaminedtheeffectsof12weeksofresistancetrain-\ning on body composition, muscle hypertrophy and func-\ntion, blood lipid levels, and hemorheological properties in\nmiddle-aged obese women to assess the effectiveness of\nresistance exercise as an exercise intervention for obesity\ntreatment. Resistancetrainingfor12weeksmaypositively\naffect body composition, muscle hypertrophy and func-\ntion, blood lipid levels, and hemorheological properties in\nmiddle-agedobesewomenwitha25–30kg/m 2 BMI.\n2.

Blood samples were collected from the fin-\ngertips (20 µL), and venous (10 mL) by a trained nurse in\na sitting position. The skinfold and circumference of the\nwaist,hip,triceps,biceps,andthighweremeasuredtocal-\nculatethecross-sectionalarea(CSA)[ 39]. Isokineticmus-\nclefunctionwasmeasuredat60°formusclestrength(peak\ntorque [PT], PT/BW) and 180° for muscular endurance\n(meanpower,totalwork[TW]).\nAfter the testing session, the participants were ran-\ndomly assigned to the CON, which maintained the same\ndailylifestyleasbefore,ortheEXP,whichunderwentare-\nsistancetrainingprogram. Theresistancetrainingprogram\nconsisted of 10 min of warm-up, 60 min of the main exer-\ncise,and10minofcool-down;therestperiodbetweeneach\nexerciseandthenextwassetwithin1–2min. Thewarm-up\nand cool-down consisted of dynamic and static stretching,\nrespectively; resistance training consisted of four move-\nments of the upper body (bench press, preacher bench bi-\ncepscurl,barbellrowing,anddumbbellshoulderpress)and\nfourmovementsofthelowerbody(deadlift, barbellsquat,\nseated leg extension, and lying leg curl). The main resis-\ntance exercise consisted of 3–4 sets of 8–10 repetitions at\n70–80% of one repetition maximum (1-RM) after measur-\ning 1-RM. The training frequency was 80 min, 3 days per\nweek, for 12 weeks. The number of repetitions and sets\nwas increased every 3 weeks according to the principle of\nincreasing the load of exercise prescription (Fig.2). The\nresistance training program were performed at a gym in\nSeoul,andahealthtrainerresidingatthegymfullyunder-\nstood our training program and guided the participants to\nperformtheexercise.\n3\n\n2.3 Measurement\n2.3.1BodyComposition\nBody composition parameters, including BW (kg),\nleanbodymass(kg),fatmass(kg),andbodyfatpercentage\n(%),ofallparticipantswereestimatedusingabioelectrical\nimpedance analyzer (Inbody 770, Inbody, Seoul, Korea),\nandBMI(kg/m 2)wascalculatedusingformulaeforheight\nandweight. Allparticipantsworelightweightclothingand\nwereaskedtoremoveallmetallicitemsfromtheirbodies.\n2.3.2BloodPressure\nThe resting blood pressure, systolic blood pressure\n(SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured\ntwice in the sitting position after a minimum of 5 min rest\nusing an automatic sphygmomanometer (HBP-9020, OM-\nRON Colin, Tokyo, Japan). The average value was used\nforanalysesandcalculationofmeanarterialbloodpressure\n(meanarterialbloodpressure(MAP)=DBP+[SBP–DBP]\n/3)andpulsepressure(pulsepressure(PP)=SBP–DBP).\n2.3.3MuscleHypertrophy\nTo evaluate muscular hypertrophy, the CSA was cal-\nculatedbymeasuringtheskinfoldandcircumferenceofthe\nwaist,hip,triceps,biceps,andthigh[ 40,41]. Thewaistand\nhip circumferences were measured twice with a tapeline,\nwiththeparticipantstandingonaflatfloor,theaveragewas\nused, and the unit was measured to 0.1 cm. The thigh cir-\ncumference was measured twice using a tapeline with the\nparticipant standing in an upright position with both legs\n10–15 cm apart and the weight of both feet equal; the av-\neragewasused, andtheunitwasmeasuredto0.1cm. The\nskinfold of the thigh was measured by grabbing fat from\nthe front of the thigh between the hip and knee using the\nthumb and index finger, measured twice, and the average\nwasused,andtheunitwasmeasuredto0.1cm.\nThe quadriceps, hamstring, and total thigh muscle\nCSAs were calculated using the following formula [39]:\nquadriceps CSA (cm2) = (2.52× thigh circumference) –\n(1.25× thighskinfolder)–45.13,hamstringCSA(cm 2)=\n(1.08 × thigh circumference) – (0.64× thigh skin folder)\n–22.69,andtotalthighmuscleCSA(cm 2)=(1.08 × thigh\ncircumference)–(2.09 × thighskinfolder)–80.99.\n2.3.4MuscleFunction\nMusclefunctionwasmeasuredusingBiodex(Biodex\nMedical Systems, New York, NY, U.S.). With the partici-\npant sitting on the measuring chair, the center point of the\njoint was adjusted using a table and backrest to coincide\nwith the dynamometer’s axis of rotation. During flexion\nand extension exercises, the thigh and chest were fixed to\nprevent external force application to other body parts than\nthe exercised part. The range of motion of the knee joint\nwas designated as 0° of extension and 90° of flexion and\nwas measured after performing gravity correction to ex-\ncludetheeffectofgravity. Throughthis,isokineticmuscle\nstrengthandmuscularenduranceweremeasured. Formus-\nclestrengthmeasurement,thePTandrelativePT(PT/BW)\nwerecalculatedbyperformingextensionandflexionwitha\nmaximum force four times at an angular velocity of 60°/s.\nMuscleendurancewasmeasured11timesatanangularve-\nlocityof180°/stocalculatetheaveragepowerandTW.\n2.3.5BloodLipidLevel\nBlood lipid levels were measured using Lipidocare\n(SD Biosensor, Inc., Seoul, Korea). After fasting for more\nthan 8 h the day before the test, blood samples were col-\nlected, and lipid levels, including TG, TC, HDL-C, and\nLDL-C,weremeasuredusingthefingertipsmethod.\n2.3.6HemorheologicalProperties\nRBC deformability and aggregation were evaluated\nas hemorheological parameters to evaluate microvascu-\nlar circulation function. RBC deformability and aggre-\ngation were analyzed using Rheoscan-D (Rheo Meditech\nInc., Seoul, Korea) under environmental conditions of 25\n°C and 3 Pa shear stress within 4–6 h after blood collec-\ntion. RBC deformability was measured using the elon-\ngation index (EI) by first transferring the sample into a\n2 mL microseparation tube, which was diluted in 700 µL\nof 5.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone (360 kDa) dissolved in 1\nmmol phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4; osmolality: 300\nmOsmol/kg) in a K3-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tube\n(GreinerBio-one,ChonNuri,Thailand). Thissolution(0.5\nmL) was then analyzed using a D-test kit, according to\nthe manufacturer’s instructions. The accuracy of the RBC\nEI was measured using a Lineweaver–Burk plot model.\nRBC aggregation was measured using the aggregation in-\ndex(AI),and8µLofthewholebloodsamplewasanalyzed\nusinganA-testkit,accordingtothemanufacturer’sinstruc-\ntions.\n2.4 Statistical Analysis\nWith the aid of the G*power analysis tool, the sam-\nple size was determined. Based on data from a similar\nstudyinhealthywomen,apoweranalysisusinganɑ-level\nand power of 0.05 and 0.90, respectively, showed a suffi-\ncient samplesize of 18 participants. All statistical analy-\nseswereconductedusingtheSPSSsoftware(version25.0;\nIBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) for Windows. Data were\npresentedasmean ± standarddeviation. Thenormalityas-\nsumption was confirmed using the Shapiro–Wilks test be-\nfore performing parametric statistics. A two-way analysis\n(time × group) of variance with repeated measures of the\n“time” factor was used to analyze the effects of the train-\ning programs on each dependent variable. A pairedt-test\nwasusedtocomparethepost-trainingandpre-trainingval-\nuesofthedependentvariablesineachgroupseparately. In\naddition, the Cohen’s d, an effect size that reflects statis-\nticalvaluescalculatedfromdatasamplesandstandardized\nmeandifferences,wascalculatedforclinicalinterpretation\n4\n\n\nofthedata. Thestatisticaldifferenceinthemeanswas de-\ntermined using the significance level and 95% confidence\ninterval (CI). Significant effects were evaluated using the\nCohen’s d effect size (small d = 0.2, medium d = 0.5, and\nlarged=0.8effectsize). Thelevelofsignificancewasset\naprioriat p < 0.05.\n3.

Therefore, as in previous studies, a long-\ntermresistanceexerciseprogramapplicationcouldsignifi-\ncantlyimprovebodycompositionintheEXP.\n4.2 Blood Pressure\nSeveralsystematicreviewsandmeta-analysesofpre-\nvious studies on the relationship between resistance exer-\ncise programs and blood pressure have reported that long-\nterm resistance exercise programs improve blood pressure\nand cardiovascular disease risk factors in various partici-\npants(e.g., obesity, metabolicsyndrome, andcardiovascu-\nlardisease)[ 44–46]. Followingtheexaminationofthe12-\nweek resistance exercise program effect on blood pressure\ninthisstudy,therewasnosignificantchangeinSBP,DBP,\nMAP,andPPintheCONandEXP;theseresultswerecon-\nsistent with those of Tibanaet al. [47] and Cortez-Cooper\net al. [48]. The absence of change in blood pressure may\nbe due to the relatively short training period (12 weeks),\nsimilar to previous studies with the same results, and all\nparticipants’initialbloodpressurewerenormalorelevated\nlevels. In addition, this is supported by the American Col-\nlege of Sports Medicine (ACSM) report that the decrease\ninbloodpressurefollowinglong-termexercisetreatmentis\nrelatedtotheinitialbloodpressurelevel(ACSM,2004).\n4.3 Muscle Hypertrophy and Function\nSeveral previous studies reported that resistance ex-\nercise programs significantly increased CSA [49,50], and\nthat high-intensity exercise was more effective for muscle\nhypertrophythanlow-intensityexercise[ 51,52]. However,\ninthisstudy,despitetheinterventionofahigh-intensityre-\nsistanceexerciseprogramofsimilardurationandintensity\ntopreviousstudiesthatshowedsignificantimprovementin\nCSA, no significant changes were observed in the quadri-\nceps, hamstrings, and total thigh muscle CSA. Although\nprevious studies reported that differences in macronutrient\nintake, especially protein intake, could affect the muscle\nhypertrophyeffectofresistanceexerciseprograms[ 53,54],\nthisstudydidnotcontrolparticipants’dietanddidnotcon-\nduct nutrition education and surveys. Therefore, it can be\ninferred that sufficient protein intake for muscle synthesis\nwasnotachieved[ 55]. Inadditiontoproteinintake,testos-\nterone,anandrogenanabolichormone,alsoaffectsmuscle\nhypertrophy. Generally, testosterone levels rise immedi-\nately after a high-intensity resistance exercise program in\nmen. However, the results of studies on testosterone re-\nsponse to a resistance exercise program in women are un-\ncertain. In addition, testosterone levels decrease gradually\nin women until menopause and then decrease rapidly after\nmenopause [56]. Considering muscle protein synthesis re-\nsponse in older people is reported to be lower than that in\nyounger individuals [57], the relatively short program du-\nrationisbelievedtobeinsufficientformusclehypertrophy\ntooccurin“middle-agedwomen”inthisstudy[ 58]. Inthis\nstudy, although not significant, CSA tended to decrease in\ntheCONandincreasedormaintainedintheEXPfollowing\nthe12-weekresistanceexerciseprogram;ifalong-termre-\nsistanceexerciseprogramofmorethan6monthsisapplied\ninfurtherstudies,CSAmayimproveasinpreviousstudies\n[50].\nTheincreaseinmuscleCSAanddevelopmentofmus-\nclefunctionarehighlycorrelated[ 59],butthedevelopment\nof muscle function also occurs through a combination of\nmuscle morphological improvement and neurological de-\nvelopment [60]. The development of muscle function fol-\nlowing the resistance exercise program could be mediated\nbyincreasedmusclehypertrophyoractivationofthemotor\nunit,aunitofnervesthatcontrolsmuscles[ 61,62]. Milner-\nBrownandLee[ 63]reportedthata6-weekresistanceexer-\nciseprogramimprovedmusclefunctionbyincreasingmo-\ntorunitsynchronization. Aagaard et al. [64]suggestedthat\nahigh-intensityresistanceexerciseprogramcouldactivate\nmotor units, thereby improving muscle function. In addi-\ntion,Toth et al. [65]andBrandenburgandDocherty[ 66]re-\nportedthatmusclestrengthincreasedsignificantlythrough\na resistance exercise program, although muscle hypertro-\nphy, such as increased CSA, did not occur. These results\nprove that muscle function was significantly increased by\nthe resistance exercise program in our study, despite the\nabsenceofmusclehypertrophy, suchasincreasedCSA.In\naddition,asthetrainingvolumeincreases,theratiooftype\nⅡx,whichhasarelativelylargeCSAareaandhighconduc-\ntionspeed,decreases,andtheratioofⅡxcanbemaintained\nas the volume is moderate or low [67]. It is believed that\nthedevelopmentofmusclefunctionwithoutCSAincrease\nintheparticipantsinthisstudywasduetothemoderateor\nlowtrainingvolume. However,theinabilitytomeasureand\ninterprettheresultsofmuscleactivationwasalimitationof\nthisstudy.\n4.4 Blood Lipid Level\nIn previous studies that conducted systematic anal-\nysis and meta-analysis on blood lipid levels improve-\nmentthroughresistanceexerciseprograms,itwasreported\nthatlong-termresistanceexerciseprogramseffectivelyim-\nprovedbloodlipidlevels[ 44–46]. Accordingtotheguide-\nlinesforexerciseandphysicalactivityofACSM,resistance\nexercisecanincreaseHDL-CanddecreaseLDL-CandTG\nlevels(ACSM,2009). Somepreviousstudiesreportedsig-\nnificant improvements in participants’ TG, TC, HDL-C,\nand LDL-C levels following resistance exercise programs\n[68,69],butOlson et al. [70]andBanz et al. [71]reported\nnosignificantimprovementinbloodlipidlevelsafterare-\nsistanceexerciseprogram.\n8\n\n\nConsistent with the findings of Olsonet al. [70], this\nstudydidnotshowanychangeinbloodlipidlevelsafterthe\n12-weekresistanceexerciseprogram. Althoughthepartic-\nipants in this study were obese middle-aged women, their\nbloodlipidlevelswerewithinarelativelynormalrangebe-\nfore exercise; thus, no improvement in blood lipid levels\nwasreportedfollowingtheresistanceexerciseprogram. In\nthe absence of a change in diet, improving body composi-\ntionandmetabolicprofileisassociatedwithincreasedlean\nbody mass and increased type Ⅰ and Ⅱa CSA [72]. No in-\ncreaseinleanbodymassorCSAwasobservedinthisstudy,\nsuggesting that a healthier metabolic profile was not ob-\nserved. In addition, although blood lipid levels are greatly\ninfluenced by diet, there are limitations in interpreting the\nresultsofthisstudybecausenutritioneducationandsurveys\nwerenotperformedontheparticipants.\n4.5 Hemorheological Properties\nHemorheologicalpropertiesrefertothephysicalprop-\nertiesofthebloodcellsthatplayanimportantroleincircu-\nlation to tissues through microvessels. The most represen-\ntativevariablesincludebloodviscosity,plasmacoagulation\nprotein, RBC deformability, and aggregation [73,74]. The\nmajorfunctionofRBCsistofacilitatetheexchangeofoxy-\ngenandcarbondioxidewiththesurrounding tissuesinthe\nmicrocirculation. In practice, RBCs sometimes need to be\ndeformedtoflowthroughcapillariessmallerthantheirsize\n[75]. Anincreaseinbloodviscosityincreasesthefrictional\nforceonthebloodvesselwall,therebyreducingbloodflow,\nwhichisexplainedbythetermshearrateandactsasalim-\niting factor in the oxygen-carrying capacity, increasing the\ninduction rate of heart disease due to obesity. Conversely,\nreducedbloodandplasmaviscosityincreasethearteriove-\nnous oxygen difference, positively affecting obesity and\nlifestylediseases[ 33,74,76,77]. Regularexerciseincreases\nvasodilation,upregulatesendothelialnitricoxide(NO)syn-\nthasetoincreasebloodflow,aswellasstimulatesbonemar-\nrowactivity,andupregulatesfactorsthatincreaseRBCpro-\nduction. However, studies on improving hemorheological\npropertiesthroughexercisehavemainlyfocusedonaerobic\nexercise. Only a few studies have confirmed the improve-\nmentinRBCdeformabilityandaggregationafterresistance\nexercise. Therefore,thisstudyaimedtoexaminetheeffect\nofa12-weekresistanceexerciseprogramonthehemorhe-\nologicalpropertiesofmiddle-agedobesewomen.\nCakir-Atabek et al. [34] divided young male partic-\nipants into two groups: moderate-intensity (70% 1-RM,\nthreesetsof12repetitions)andhigh-intensity(85%1-RM,\nthree sets of 6 repetitions), and investigated the effect of a\n6-week resistance exercise program on RBC deformation\nandaggregation. Theyreportedasignificantimprovement\nin RBC deformability in both groups, but the moderate-\nintensityresistanceexerciseprogramshowedagreaterim-\nprovement in RBC deformability than the high-intensity\nexercise program. Although the participant characteristics\nand exercise types are different, Kimet al. [78] examined\ntheeffectofa12-weekcomplexexerciseprogramconsist-\ning of resistance and aerobic exercise on hemorheological\nproperties in obese older men; the long-term complex ex-\nercise program was effective in improving RBC deforma-\nbility and aggregation. Simmondset al. [79] reported that\nwhenanolderpersonwithahistoryoftype2diabetesper-\nformed aerobic exercise for 12 weeks, the RBC AI signif-\nicantly decreased, and the EI increased in older women.\nThrough a literature study, Hu and Lin [80] found that\nthe ratio of young RBCs with excellent deformability was\nhigher in people who continuously exercised. It has been\nreportedthatthisisbecausemanyRBCswithweakenedde-\nformabilityduetotheendoftheirlifespanof90–120days\nareremovedwhenexerciseisperformed. Inaddition,Smith\net al. [81] argued that the improvement in hemorheologi-\ncalpropertiesthroughexerciseisduetotheupregulationof\nerythropoietin, a hormone that regulates the production of\nRBCs.\nSimilartopreviousstudies,thisstudy’s12-weekresis-\ntanceexerciseprogramsignificantlyimprovedtheRBCEI\nandAIinmiddle-agedobesewomen. Thisisthoughttobe\ncausedbyincreasedblooddemandformuscletissues,such\nasvascularelasticityandvascularendothelialcellfunction\nenhancement by NO, which are adaptive phenomena that\noccur through resistance exercise [82,83]. Further studies\narenecessarytounderstandtheeffectoftheresistanceexer-\ncise program on hemorheological properties and more de-\ntailsofthemechanisms.\n4.6 Limitations\nThisstudyhadseverallimitations. First,althoughthe\nparticipants of this study were middle-aged women aged\n50.79±5.80years,menstrualcycleandsexhormoneswere\nnot measured, and some participants were possibly post-\nmenopausal women. Second, participants’ daily physical\nactivities were not investigated. The results may vary de-\npending on the participants’ physical abilities. Third, this\nstudydidnotcontroltheparticipants’dietduringtheexer-\ncise intervention period and did not conduct nutrition edu-\ncationandsurveys.\nThis should explore the significance of the results of\nthework,notrepeatthem.
