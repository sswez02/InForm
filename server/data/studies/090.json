    "results": "of exercise interventions on muscle ma ss, fat mass, bone mass, \nstrength and physical performance in community dwelling older adults (OA). A systematic search was carried \nout in eleven databases, using validated terms as “aged”, “exercise” and others. For the meta -analysis, we \ndifferentiated by type of exercise and outcome. Twenty -nine randomized clinical trials were obtained for the \nreview and 24 clinical trials for meta -analysis. This study identified an increase of 1.0 kg (95% Confidence \nInterval [CI] 0.3 -1.7) in total muscle mass (TMM) and 0.4 kg (95%CI 0.0,0.7) in appendicular muscle mass \n(AMM); a decrease of -3.7 kg (95% CI -5.8, -1.5) in total fat mass and -3.7% (95%CI -5.8, -1.5) in fat percentage \nafter the resistance exercise intervention by 2 -3 times per week. A -3.0% (95%CI -4.6, -1.3) decrease was \nobserved in fat percentage after the aerobic exercise intervention. The quality of the evidence was ranked from \nhigh to very low; the risk of bias most common was performance bias and other bias. This study suggests that \nresistance exercise is the intervention that shows a positive effect on muscle fat mass, and bone mass. More \nresearch is needed for other exercise interventions. \n \nKey words: muscle mass, fat mass, physical performance, muscular strength, older adults, Meta-analysis. \n \n \n \nGlobally, a demographic transition process is being \nexperienced [1]. According to the World Health \nOrganization (WHO), projections for 2050 suggest that \n60% of the population in Europe will be 60 years or older, \nwhile in North America and Latin -America and the \nCaribbean, the percentage will be approximately 28% and \n25% respectively [2]. This accelerated process poses new \nchallenges for the design of health policies and strategies \nfor this population. Older adults (OA) are a vulnerable \ngroup; therefore, it is necessary to generate scientific \nevidence that helps improve thei r quality of life and \npromote healthy aging. Developing and maintaining \nVolume 13, Number 5; 1421-1435, October 2022 \n\n\n Gonzá lez-Rocha A., et al. Exercise on muscle, fat, and bone mass in older adults \nAging and Disease • Volume 13, Number 5, October 2022 1422 \n \nfunctional abilities that allows well-being in older age is a \nprocess defined by WHO (2015) as healthy aging [2]. \nMuscle mass, fat mass, and bone mass, muscular \nstrength, and physical performance are three key elements \nin the health status of the older adults. They are strong \npredictors for different geriatric syndromes (GS), such as \nsarcopenia, osteoporosis, and its derivations [3]. For \nexample, osteosarcopenic obesity (OSO) is characterized \nby alterations in three tissues: bone, muscle, and adipose \ntissue [4]. Ageing becomes one of the main risk factors \nfor GS that are linked with worse conditions such as \nfrailty, increased risk of fractures, physical disability, and \nlonger hospital stays [5]. \nFrom 20 -80 years muscle mass loss had been \nestimated 35-40%, also a difference of 20 -40% between \nyoung and OA in muscle strength and increases more than \n50% in adults over 80 years [6]. After menopause, there \nis an increase of body weight and fat mass percentage as \na result of incrementation in visceral fat and diminished \nfat-free mass. In men, testosterone promotes muscle \nregeneration through the activation of satellite cells; \ntestosterone decreases approximately 1% per year, which \ncan negatively affect the distribution of muscle mass and \nfat mass aging [7]. The hormonal axis, including the \nsomatotropic axis (GH/Insulin-like growth factor-1 IGF-\n1) related to protein metabolism, th e rate of muscle \nexcitation and contraction is associated to reduce their \nactivity with increasing age; therefore, the ratio of muscle \nquality has a significant decrease associated with age \n[8,9]. After 50 years old, the average annual bone loss is \n1-2% per year. In total, one of three women in this life \nstage experience osteoporotic fractures, while in men it \noccurs in one of five [10]. The loss of muscle mass is \naccompanied by a greater decline in muscle strength and \npower that can lead to accelerated mus cle atrophy, \nresulting in increased risk of physical disability [11]. \nPhysical performance has been defined as an \nobjective measurement of the body’s function and \nlocomotion [12]. Some physiological changes such as loss \nof motor units, changes in fiber typ es, atrophy of muscle \nfibers, and reduction of neuromuscular activation can \naffect the speed, strength, and power of movements \nleading to a reduction in physical performance [13]. It is \nimportant to include other components as fat mass, bone \nmass and mus cle mass to have a better insight when \ncomparing functional and strength measures, the gap \nlinking muscle mass, strength and functionality will \nreduce [3]. \nPrevious studies have suggested that exercise has an \nimportant effect on the functionality and body \ncomposition of older adults [13,14]. For example, Cruz -\nJentoft et al. have concluded that strength and resistance \nexercise can improve the physical performance of senior \nadults, specifically in chair lifting tests, 12 -minute walks \nand stair climbing. Mixed strength and aerobic exercise \nshow an improvement in muscle strength, however, no \nincreases in muscle mass were observed in either case \n[15]. Steffl et al. (2017) observed that physical activity \nhas a protective affect against the development of \nsarcopenia [16]. \nThus, the aim of this systematic review is to assess \nthe effect of exercise on muscle mass, fat mass, bone \nmineral content, strength, and physical performance for \ncommunity dwelling older adults.",

The protocol was published at \nPROSPERO, ID: CRD42020207148. \n \nCriteria for include studies in this review \n \nType of studies \n \nThe studies included were randomized clinical trials \n(RCTs), without language restrictions, from January 2010 \nto October 2021. We decided to make a cut from almost \nten years back in the literature, taking in consideration that \nthe evidence is in constant renovation. \n \nTypes of participants \n \nThe participants considered for this review were healthy \naged population, adults older of 60 years, who lived in a \ncommunity with sarcopenia or pre -sarcopenia o \ndiminished muscle mass. The exclusion criteria were \nclinical trials where the participants were living in \nhospitals or were institutionalized, participants with \nhealth complications as cancer, heart failure, kidney \nfailure, diabetes and in recovery of post -acute illness or \npost-surgery. \n \nTypes of interventions \n \nWere included all kind of exercise, trials comparing \nexercise to control group or other exercise group. As \nexclusion criteria, were excluded trials that combined \nexercise intervention with nutrition supplementation or \nspecific diet, and electrostimulation. \n \nTypes of outcomes \n \nMajor outcomes: Muscle mass, fat mass and bone mass, \nmeasured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), \nbioimpedance (BIA) or tomography computerized (CT). \n\n Gonzá lez-Rocha A., et al.

In the event of \ndisagreement, a third author decided whether or not to \ninclude the article (LM-S for the screening and ED-G for \nthe quantitative identification). The selection stages are \nfound in the Figure 1. \n \nData extraction and management \n \nThe information was extracted based on the PICO \nquestion, beginning by identifying the initial \ncharacteristics of the Population, such as age, sex and size \nof the sample studied. For Intervention and Comparison, \ncharacteristics of the type of intervention were organized \naccording to frequency, intensity, type of exercise, time \nand progression of exercise, time of the intervention, and \ntime of follow-up. We used categories to divide in types \nof exercise as: resistance exercise, aerobic exercise, and \nmixed exercise (aerobic + resistance exercise). The \nOutcomes were organized by changes in body \ncomposition, seeking to identify the chan ges in muscle \nmass (total and appendicular), fat mass (percentage and in \ngrams), and bone mass (bone mineral density [BMD]). \nChanges in physical performance (gait speed, short \nphysical performance battery [SPPB], Timed up and Go \ntest [TUG]) and in muscular strength (grip strength and \nchair lift) were evaluated. \n \nRisk of bias assessment \n \nTwo reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias for \neach study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane \nHandbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [17]: \n1) random sequence generation (selection bias), 2) \nallocation concealment (selection bias), 3) blinding of \nparticipants and personnel (performance bias), 4) blinding \nof outcome assessment (detection bias), 5) incomplete \noutcome data (attrition bias), 6) sele ctive outcome \nreporting (reporting bias) and, 7) other bias. \nEach potential bias was graded as high, low or unclear \nrisk. Risk of bias was evaluated by AG-R and LM-S. \n \nPublication bias \n \nA funnel plot was performed with Review Manager 5.4 \nsoftware, for the outcomes we had enough data. \n\n Gonzá lez-Rocha A., et al.

Finally, 29 studies \n[19–47] were included in the qualitat ive analysis and 24 \nin the quantitative analysis. Four studies [19,21,43,44] \nthat had just intervention groups and one [25] with data in \npercentage of change were excluded of quantitative \nanalysis as they were not comparable with the other \nstudies. \nIncluded Studies \n \nThe main characteristics of the primary studies are \ndescribed in Table 1. \n\n\n Gonzá lez-Rocha A., et al. Exercise on muscle, fat, and bone mass in older adults \nAging and Disease • Volume 13, Number 5, October 2022 1428 \n \nAll the studies were RCTs. In 15 studies [20,25,27–\n34, 39,41,48] participants were only women, 13 studies \n[19,21–23,26,36,37,40,42,43,46,49,50] had participants \nof both genders and one [38] did not report the gender of \nthe participants. In terms of the place where the studies \nwere carried out, seven studies were carried out in Taiwan \n[22,23,27,33–35,47], seven in Japan [30–32,36,37,44,50], \nfive in Korea [26,28,29,40,41], two in Brazil [25,48], two \nin Poland [38,39] and only one in the United States of \nAmerica (USA) [19], China [46], Italy [43], Canada [21], \nIran [20], and Greece [42]. \nRegarding the three types of interventions \ncategorized, 19 studies had a resis tance-type exercise \nintervention [19–21,23,25–27,30–35,38,41,43,44,47,48, \n50], three studies had an aerobic -type intervention \n[23,29,39], and nine had a mixed intervention (resistance \n+ aerobic exercise) [22,23,28,31,36,37,40,42,46]. \nRegarding the duration of the intervention for the \nresistance exercise intervention, 12 studies their \nintervention lasted 12 weeks [26,27,31,34,39,42,46,48], \nin three studies lasted less than 12 weeks [23,47,51], and \nin four studies it lasted longer than 12 weeks [19, \n25,37,52]. Regarding the number of sessions, the mode \nwas three sessions of physical exercise per week. For \naerobic exercise, two studies [29,39] were by 12 weeks, \nthree sessions per week and one st udy [23] was by eight \nweeks, two times per week. For mixed exercise six studies \n[22,28,31,36,42,46] had the duration of 12 weeks, 24 \nweeks for two studies [37,40] and eight weeks for one \nstudy[23], the range of sessions per weeks was one to five \nsessions per week, three studies had two sessions per \nweek. \n \nRisk of Bias assessment \n \nThe risk of bias graph and summary can be found in the \nSupplementary Figure 1. \nA high risk in other biases was also identified; for \nexample: selection bias, since in several o f the selected \nstudies the participants enrolled in the clinical trial by \ntheir own initiative, which could suggest that these OA are \nmore interested in exercise and taking care of their health. \n \nRandom sequence generation (selection bias) \n \nSix studies [22,23,26,39,42,47] are at unclear risk for not \nspecifying the method in which the random sequence was \ngenerated. \n \n \nAllocation concealment (selection bias) \n \nNine studies [19,22,23,26,37,39,41,47,49] have an \nunclear risk as they did not report the method used to \nconceal allocation between groups. Tsekoura et al. [42] \nare at high risk because the participants were given \nenvelopes and they could easily see each other’s \nallocations. \n \nBlinding of partici pants and personnel (performance \nbias) \n \nA total of 11 studies [21,25,30,32,34–36,38,42,43,46,47] \nhave unclear risk. For example, Liao et al. (2017) reported \nblinding of the participants; however, they also notified \nthe participants of the types of interventions by informed \nconsent had low risk. Yamada et al. (2019) had low risk \nof bias because they report blinding for the participants \nand for the personnel. A total of 17 studies [20,22,23,26–\n29,31,33,37,39–41,44,48] have a high risk of bias due to \nthe natur e of the intervention, because it is difficult to \nkeep participants blinded as they had to know the \nintervention and possible adverse effects. \n \nBlinding of outcome assessment (detection bias) \n \nFifteen studies [21,22,25,26,28,29,31,37–40,43,47,48,50] \nhad an unclear risk as they did not report clearly blinding. \n \nIncomplete outcome data (attrition bias) \n \nSix studies [25,32,34,39,47,49] have unclear risk because \nthey do not report this. Two studies [37,46] have a high \nrisk of bias because the loss of participants affects the \nbalance of the randomized groups. \n \nSelective outcome reporting (reporting bias) \n \nTwelve studies [19,23,26,29,31,34–37,43,47,48] have \nunclear risk, mainly because they did not report or publish \ntheir protocol. \n \nEffects of interventions \n \nStudies were identified to had comparable data for the \nquantitative analysis, these studies were classified by type \nof exercise and unit of measure. In this sense, 13 studies \n[20,23,26,27,32–35,38,41,47,48,50] were identified from \nresistance exercise intervention, three studies [23,29,39] \nfor aerobic intervention and eight [22,23,28,31,36,37, 40, \n42,46] for mixed exercise. \n \nThe certainty of evidence \n \nThe complete GRADE Summary of Findings table for all \nthe comparisons are reported in Supplementary Table 2. \nThe certainty of evidence was evaluated in the \ncomparison of resistance exercise vs. control group for \n\n Gonzá lez-Rocha A., et al.

C) Total body fat (kg) and Fat mass percentage (%). D) Total bone mineral density g/cm2. \nResistance exercise interventions \n \nConsidering our primary outcome and resistance exercise, \nwe compared seven studies [23,26,30,35,43,47,48] for \nmuscle mass, measured by tot al muscle mass (Kg) (Fig . \n2A) with 146 total participants in the intervention 2 -3 \ntimes per week compared to 130 older adults in the control \ngroup, had an increase of 1.0kg (95%CI 0.3 -1.7), \nheterogeneity of I 2 = 0%. In another analysis, about \nappendicular muscle mass (ASM), seven studies \n[26,30,32,33,38,41,47] were included, with a total of 184 \nparticipants in the intervention and 185 in control group, \nheterogeneity of I2 = 0%, showed an increase of 0.4 kg (CI \n95%: 0.07, 0.74) (Fig. 2B). \nWe evaluated three studies [27,34,47] with a total of \n60 participants in the intervention and 54 in the control \ngroup that estimated the total fat mass (TFM) (kg) (Fig . \n2C) and eight studies [20,23,26,27,33–35,48] with 169 \nparticipants in the intervention group and 152 participants \nin the control group estimating fat mass percentage \n(FM%) (Fig . 2C). This intervention results in a large \nreduction of 3.7 kg (95% CI: -5.8, -1.5) with heterogeneity \nof I2= 0% and a decrease of 2.1% (9 5% CI: -3.12, -1.12) \nwith heterogeneity of I2= 21% respectively. \nFindings in body composition measured by total \nBMD, were found in five studies [20,27,33,41,48] with a \ntotal of 98 participants and 91 older adults in control \ngroup. The intervention had a slightly increase of 0.03 \n(95%CI 0.00 – 0.07) with I2= 0% (Fig, 2D). \nEvaluating strength, with handgrip strength resistance \nexercise results in a large increase 2.8 kg (CI 95%: 1.6, \n4.0) in seven studies [23,30,33,34,38,43,47] with 149 \nparticipants (Supplementary Fig, 2A) and for timed chair \nrise, results in large increase 5.4 times (IC 95%: 4.16, \n6.66) (Supplementary Fig . 2D) in 3 studies [26,34,35] \nwith 69 participants and 56 control. In physical \nperformance, TUG results in large reduction -2.06 \nseconds (Supplementary Fig. 2C) (IC 95%: -2.6, -1.5) in \n5 studies [26,30,33–35], with 114 participants and I2= 0%, \nfor gait speed the overall difference observed has no \nclinical relevance and is inconsistent (Supplementary Fig. \n2B). \n\n\n Gonzá lez-Rocha A., et al. Exercise on muscle, fat, and bone mass in older adults \nAging and Disease • Volume 13, Number 5, October 2022 1430 \n \nAerobic exercise interventions \n \nThis meta -analysis was conducted of three studies \n[23,29,39] with 51 participants in the aerobic exercise \nintervention 2-3 times per week and 50 in the control by \nfixed effects model with heterogeneity of I 2 = 0%. The \nresults observed indicate a large re duction of -3.0% (CI \n95%: -4.6, -1.3) in fat mass percentage (Fig. 3). \n \nFigure 3. Effect of aerobic exercise intervention in community-dwelling older adults over fat mass percentage (%). \nMixed exercise interventions \n \nMixed exercise intervention results in little to no \ndifference for muscle mass gain. The analysis of three \nstudies [28,37,42]; including both intervention groups by \nTsekoura et al. [42] with total of 83 participants receiving \nan intervention 2-3 times per week, with a heterogeneity \nI2=0% evaluated by the fixed effects model showed an \nincrease of 0.1 (95%CI -0.0, 0.3). Also, were analyzed \nFM% for this intervention in four studies [23,31,37,40], \nwith 101 participants receiving 2-3 times per week and 88 \nin the control group with a reduction by -1.4% (95% CI -\n3.2, 0.2), heterogeneity I2= 31% (Fig. 4). Both outcomes \nhad not statistical significance. \nFor strength, were included six studies [23,28,31, \n40,42,46] with 112 participants with 2 -3 times per week \nintervention and 109 in control group evaluating \nhandgrip, results in a slightly increase of 2.2kg (95% CI \n0.0, 4.4) with heterogeneity I2 = 66%. For gait speed were \nincluded four studies [31,37,42,46] with 103 participants \nin the intervention 2-3 times per week and 83 participants \nin the control. They result in an increase of 0.08m/s (CI \n95%: 0.03, 0.14) when compared with no exercise , with \nheterogeneity I2 = 17% (Supplementary Fig. 3). \nAdditionally, in the analysis by the total of sessions \nwere found for total muscle mass an increase of 1.06 (95% \nCI: 0.15, 1.98) after 36 sessions (3 sessions per week). \nThe detail of the additional ana lysis by total session are \ndescribed in Supplementary Figure. 4. \n \nPublication bias \n \nFunnel plots are presented in Supplementary Fig. 5. In this \nsense, no publication bias was detected. \nDISCUSSION \n \nImprovements were observed after the resistance exercise \ninterventions like, increase of total muscle mass, \nappendicular muscle mass, large decrease in total fat \nmass, and a decrease in body fat percentage. Regarding \nthe aerobic exercise intervention, a decrease of body fat \npercentage was ide ntified. For mixed exercise \nintervention, there was an increase in skeletal muscle \nmass index (SMI, defined by appendicular muscle mass \nkg / height 2 m2), but the evidence is uncertain because \nthere could be population with no effect, for FM% there \nwas a slightly reduction but significant. \nIn the secondary outcome, for resistance exercise in \nphysical performance were showed improvement in \ncertain tests, such as the timed chair rise test with \nincreased repetitions, the TUG test and gait speed with \ndecreases in time, and for muscle strength was reported an \nincrease in handgrip strength. In aerobic exercise for our \nsecondary outcome of physical performance and strength, \nnot enough information was obtained to perform a meta -\nanalysis. With the mixed exercise inte rventions, there \nwas an increase in gait speed and handgrip strength. \nThis review sought to analyze the effect of three types \nof interventions: resistance, aerobic, and mixed exercise, \nlooking to primary outcomes like, muscle mass, fat mass, \nbone mass and secondary outcomes as, muscle strength \nand physical performance. In the final review, 19 studies \nhad a resistance-type exercise intervention [19–21,23,25–\n27, 30 –35,38,41,43,44,47,48,50], three studies had an \naerobic-type intervention [23,29,39], and ni ne had a \nmixed intervention (resistance + aerobic exercise) [22,23, \n28,31,36,37,40,42,46]. We identified training programs \n\n\n Gonzá lez-Rocha A., et al. Exercise on muscle, fat, and bone mass in older adults \nAging and Disease • Volume 13, Number 5, October 2022 1431 \n \nfrom eight to 24 weeks training, one to five sessions per \nweek and 30 to 80min of workout. \n \n \n \nFigure 4. Effect of mixed exercise intervention in community-dwelling older adults over body composition. A) Skeletal muscle \nindexå (kg/m2). B) Fat mass percentage (%). \nThe findings are similar to previous meta -analyses \nconducted in this population. According to another \nreview, muscle mass increased in 82.8% of the studies \n(29/35 RCTs) following an exercise intervention, as well \nas an improvement in physical performance outcomes \n(26/28 RCTs, 92.8%) [53]. In this review, we identified \nan improvement in muscle mass after resistance exercise. \nIn other metanalysis of seven studies Kim et al. [54] also \nshows a significant improvement in appendicular muscle \nmass, handgrip strength and TUG test, but the study only \nevaluated resistance exercise interventions. Bao et al. \n[55], identified that muscle strength (measured by timed \nchair rise test) and physical performance (measured by \ngait speed and TUG) had and improvement in 22 studies, \nbut they did not stratify their results by type of exercise, \nalso this study identified that they include \ninstitutionalized older adults and premenopausal women \nthat had mean age below of 60 years old in their analysis. \nOtherwise, Escriche -Escuder et al, in their systematic \nreview and meta-analysis did not found effect on muscle \nmass, by their inclusion criteria they analyze studies that \nused the EWSOP criteria for sarcopenia diagnosis [56]. \nFor instance, an analysis with 47 studies representing \n1079 participants suggests a sig nificant association \nbetween resistance exercise and upper and lower body \nstrength improvements among older individuals [57]. \nOther reviews suggest that exercise training programs \nmay have beneficial effects on sarcopenic obesity-related \nparameters, such as body fat mass, muscle mass and \nstrength [15,58]. In that review, all three studies assessing \nthis parameter show that physical performance improved \nwith resistance training alone versus the control group \n[58]. The present study reinforc es that exercise for older \nadults is necessary and could have some benefits in \ndifferent sarcopenia-related parameters. \nPhysical exercise has a positive impact on muscle \nmass and muscle function in older adults. The biggest \neffect of exercise intervention, of any type, has been seen \non physical performance [53,59]; Lu et al, also identified \nthat resistance training and mixed exercise suggest an \nimprovement in TUG and Gait speed [60]. We identified \na large increase in the “Chair rise test” and “ TUG” after \nresistance exercise and an increase in gait speed after \nmixed exercise. \n\n\n Gonzá lez-Rocha A., et al. Exercise on muscle, fat, and bone mass in older adults \nAging and Disease • Volume 13, Number 5, October 2022 1432 \n \nAging is a process of constant changes, and a lack of \nactivity further exacerbates the loss of muscle mass and \nfunction, resulting from obesity -derived inflammation \n[61]. This review is important to find a pathway to follow \nand help older adults to improve their muscle mass, \nphysical performance, and muscle strength. The \nresistance exercise intervention helps activate the \nmolecular regulation of muscle protein synthesis that is \nregulated by intrinsic cell signaling response [62]. Thus, \nits suggested that practicing resistance exercise and \naerobic exercise will improve the utilization of energy and \nactivation of molecular responses that will also improve \nmuscle mass and decrease fat mass. \n \nStrengths and limitations \n \nA comprehensive search for clinical trials was conducted; \nhowever, trials that did not clearly report the specific \nstudy population or intervention could have been omitted. \nIn this sense, to minimize this possible bias, a systematic \nand objective process was followed for the search, for \nreporting results, and interpreting the evidence. The result \nof this analysis was evaluated on community dwelling \nolder adults, so it could not be extrapolated to older adults \nin institutions or other conditions. One of the limitations \nin this analysis concerning the risk of bias is the absence \nor low quality of the blinding of the participants (60% \nhigh risk and 20% unclear risk). Although blinding can be \ncomplex in this type of int ervention and could have an \neffect on the result. Search was conducted over the last ten \nyears of evidence. \nThree types of exercise were included in our study, a \nmetanalysis for the different organized by comparable \nmeasures in different outcomes and we c onducted the \nevaluation of certainty of the evidence. \nBesides that, according to the literature research \ncarried out for the present study, this is the first systematic \nreview and meta-analysis focused on the exclusive effect \nof three types of exercise (resistance strength, aerobic and \nmixed) on muscle mass, body fat, bone mass, muscle \nstrength and physical performance.",
    "conclusions": "Viewing our findings from a public health perspective, \nresistance exercise could treat and prevent age -related \ndeclines in muscle mass, bone mass, accumulation of fat \nmass, and physical performance. Additionally, is \nsuggested at least 36 sessions with three sessions per week \nof resistance exercise for the gain of total muscle mass. \nAerobic exercise may help to reduce the accumulation of \nfat mass.
