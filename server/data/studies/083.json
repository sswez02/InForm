    "abstract": "Background: Sarcopenia, the age -related decline in skeletal muscle mass and \nfunction, and obesity, commonly co -occur in older adults, a condition known as \n‘sarcopenic obesity’. It is currently unclear if socioeconomic status and physical activity \nare associated with sarcopenic obesity, whether sarcopenic obesity increases the risk \nof falls, poor bone health and fractures, and how sex and ethnicity influence \nassociations of sarcopenic obesity with bone health.",
    "methods": "Four observational studies and one systematic review and meta -analysis \nwere included in this thesis. The Tasmanian Older Adult Cohort (TASOAC) study, a \nprospective study of 1,099 Caucasian older adults aged ≥50 years , investigated \nwhether socioeconomic status was associated with sarcopenic obesity and whether \nthis association was mediated by physical activity . This study also determined risk \nfactors associated with incident fractures among older adults with obesity defined by \nboth BMI and body fat percentage. In a systematic review and meta-analysis including \n26 observational studies and randomised controlled trials, I explored whether older \nadults with sarcopenic obesity have poorer areal bone mineral density (aBMD), and \ngreater risk of falls and fracture s compared to individuals with obesity alone, \nsarcopenia alone, and controls (without sarcopenia and obesity). In 1,057 individuals \naged ≥50 years from the Indian Migration Study (IMS) and Andhra Pradesh Children \nand Parents Study (APCAPS), sex-specific differences in aBMD among Indians with \nsarcopenic obesity were investigated . Finally, cross -sectional analyses from three \ntrials including a total of 74 Australian adults with obesity aged ≥55 years determined \nassociations between components of obesity (body mass index (BMI) and body fat \npercentage) and sarcopenia (muscle mass: appendicular lean mass (ALM) and \nmuscle strength/power) with bone variables assessed by high-resolution peripheral \n\n 4 \nquantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry \n(DXA). \nResults: In the TASOAC study, lower educational attainment and residing in \ndisadvantaged areas were both associated with a higher likelihood for obesity, with \nthe association for area of residence mediated by physical activity levels . However, \nonly lower educational attainment was associated with a higher likelihood for \nsarcopenic obesity. We also observed in this population that obesity, defined by body \nfat percentage, as opposed to BMI, was associated with an increased likelihood for \nfractures in older adults, with falls risk assessment a consistent predictor for incident \nfractures in individuals with obesity . The systematic review and meta -analysis \ndemonstrated that individuals with sarcopenic obesity had lower aBMD and higher \nfalls risk compared with controls and obesity alone, while sarcopenic obesity was \nassociated with higher aBMD but also higher non -vertebral fracture rates compared \nwith individuals with sarcopenia alone. In Indian older adults, men with sarcopenic \nobesity had worse bone health, while both men and women with sarcopenia had \npoorer aBMD, compared with controls. In this population, obesity was associated with \nhigher aBMD in women only. The cross-sectional study of Australian older adults with \nobesity demonstrated that higher BMI, ALM and muscle power were associated with \nmore favourable bone microarchitecture, whereas body fat percentage was negatively \nassociated with cortical area.",
    "conclusion": "This series of studies provides important insights into contributors to, \nand outcomes of, sarcopenic obesity among older adults. These findings suggest that \ndisadvantaged socioeconomic st atus increases the risk of obesity and sarcopenic \nobesity, emphasising the need for public health messag ing targeting disadvantaged \npopulations. In addition, older adults with sarcopenic obesity have lower aBMD and \n\n 5 \nincreased risk of falls compared to indiv iduals with obesity and those with neither \ncondition. Despite having higher aBMD, older adults with sarcopenic obesity also have \nincreased fracture risk compared to those with sarcopenia , which could be explained \nby poorer bone microarchitecture and the fact that higher b ody fat pe rcentage is \nassociated with an increased risk of incident falls and fractures among older adults. \nNonetheless, further research is required to determine sex - and ethnicity -specific \nassociations of sarcopenic obesity with bone health and fracture risk. These findings \nalso suggest the necessity of developing interventions targeting improvements in \nmusculoskeletal health in this population of older adults. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 6 \nTable of contents \nPeer-reviewed publications during candidature..………………………………………..8 \nThesis including published works declaration …………………………………….....….9 \nAdditional peer-reviewed publications during candidature………..…………………..14 \nConference and symposium presentations……………………………………………..15 \nAcknowledgements………………………………………………………………………..17 \nTraining and skills development………………………………………………………….18 \nList of abbreviations………………………………………………………………………..21 \nSynopsis…………………………………………………………………………………….22 \nChapter 1.0 – Literature Review………………………………………………………….25 \n 1.1 – Population aging…………………………………………………………..25 \n 1.2 – Obesity in the aging population……….………………………………….27 \n 1.3 – Sarcopenia…………………………………………………………………31 \n 1.4 – Sarcopenic obesity………………………………………………………...35 \n 1.5 – Risk factors for obesity, sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity…………39 \n 1.6 – Bone and muscle health………………………….………………………54 \n 1.6.1 – Osteoporosis………………………………………………………54 \n 1.6.2 – Falls and fractures………………………………………………...60 \n 1.7 – Conclusion…………………………………………………………………65 \nStatement of aims………………………………………………………………………….66 \nChapter 2.0 – Associations between socioeconomic status and obesity, sarcopenia, \nand sarcopenic obesity in community -dwelling older adults: The Tasmanian Older \nAdult Cohort Study……..……………………………………………………...…………..69 \n2.1 –",

This unit focused on describing, summarising, \nand analysing health -related data. Topics that were covered in this unit include \nsummarising data, gra phical presentation, quantifying uncertainty in results from a \nsample, comparing two or more groups using confidence intervals, hypothesis testing \n(p-values), understanding simple statistical methods, sample distributions and \npredicting an event or identif ying risk factors for an event of interest. This unit also \ntaught students how to use Statistical Package For The Social Sciences (SPSS) and \nto perform statistical analysis. \n \nIntroduction to Clinical trials (TRM6001) \nThis unit teaches students how to create a concise protocol that involves a \nliterature review, study design, subject sampling, and recruitment, as well as how to \nformulate a clinical research question. This unit introduces students to procedures and \nregulations that must be followed from the conception of a therapeutic to the \ncompletion of clinical trials. This unit prepares students to construct a testable clinical \nresearch question and design an ethical, well -controlled, and statistically powerful \nprotocol. \n \n \n \n \n\n 19 \nIntensive Writing Course for Science Communication \n This 10-session writing course was designed to teach students practical writing \nskills which can be employed in scientific writing. This comprehensive course aimed \nat building and refining written communi cation skills with each session focusing on a \nspecific writing skill including improving coherency, accuracy, clarity, and conciseness. \n \nClinical Imaging \nDual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) \nDuring my candidature, I became proficient in the acquisition, interpretation and \nanalysis of body composition and bone mineral density assessments using DXA. \nFollowing a two -day clinical densitometry course, I received a certificate of \ncompetency from the Australian and New Zealand Bone and Miner al Society. I am \nexperienced in acquiring, analysing, and grading, whole -body, total hip and lumbar \nspine scans. \n \nPeripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) \nI have also developed skills in acquiring and analysing scans from the pQCT to \nquantify volumetric bone mineral density, muscle composition and adipose tissue \nparameters. \n \nHigh-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) \nI have also received training for patient positioning and the acquisition of HR-\npQCT scans at the radial and tibial sites. I am also proficient in the analysis of these \nscans to acquire bone parameters at the trabecular and cortical compartments. \n \n\n 20 \nClinical trials \nGood Clinical practice (GCP) \nI have received GCP certificate from the National Drug Abuse Treatment \nClinical Trials Network (NIDA) after completing a six-hour course. This course covered \nseveral topics to prepare research staff to conduct clinical trials with human \nparticipants including the role of institutional review boards, informed consent, \nconfidentiality and privacy, participant safety and adverse events , quality assurance, \nresearch protocols, documentation and record -keeping, research misconduct, \nresearch team roles and responsibilities, recruitment and retention and investigational \nnew drugs. \n \nClinical trial co-ordination \nI was a co -investigator on three research studies (Protocol ID: \nHREC/15/MonH/182; HREC/17/MonH/613; HREC/18/MonH/399) as part of the Bone \nand Muscle Health Research Group. I had several responsibilities including participant \nrecruitment and screening, conducting baseline and follow -up appointments, data \ncollection, analysing scans , monitoring exercise sessions, and performing \nadministrative responsibilities. I also had the responsibility of managing and amending \nstudy-related documents including protocol, participant information consent form and \ndata collection form and submitting any amendments to Human Research Ethics \nApplication. \n \n \n \n \n\n 21 \nList of abbreviations \n25(OH)D: 25-hydroxyvitamin D \n95% CI: 95 percent confidence interval \naBMD: areal bone mineral density \nALM: appendicular lean mass \nALMI: appendicular lean mass index \nAUD: Australian dollar \nAWGS: Asian Woking Group for Sarcopenia \nBIA: bioelectrical impedance \nBMAD: bone mineral apparent density \nBMI: body mass index \nDXA: dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry \nESPEN: European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism \nEASO: European Association for the Study of Obesity \nEWGSOP: European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People \nEWGSOP2: Revised European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People \nGLOW: Global Longitudinal study of Osteoporosis in Women \nHiRIT: high-intensity resistance and impact training \nHOMA-IR: homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance \nHR-pQCT: high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography \nHR: hazard ratio \nIL: interleukin \nIGF: insulin-like growth factor \nOR: odds ratio \nSDOC: Sarcopenia Definitions and Outcomes Consortium \nSNPs: single nucleotide polymorphisms \nTNF-α: tumour necrosis factor-alpha \nUCP: uncoupling proteins \nUSA: United States of America \nUSD: United States dollar \nVAT: visceral adipose tissue \nvBMD: volumetric bone mineral density \nWHO: World Health Organisation \n\n 22 \nSynopsis \nAgeing of populations and a concurrent rise in obesity around the world are \nleading to increased incidence of poor cardiometabolic and musculoskeletal health (1, \n2). Older adults with obesity have an increased risk for certain types of fractures, which \nmay be partly explained by poorer bone microarchitecture and physical function (3, 4). \nHowever, there is inadequate attention to fracture prevention in this population \nbecause individuals with obesity generally have higher areal bone mineral density \n(aBMD) as estimated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), which is currently \nthe gold standard assessment for osteoporosis (5). \nObesity is primarily defined by body mass index ( BMI) which is positively \nassociated with aBMD , and this likely contributes to the reported lower risk for \nosteoporosis in individuals with obesity (6, 7). In addition to estimating aBMD, DXA is \na low cost and accurate measure of lean and fat mass, but it is unclear whether obesity \ndefined by DXA-determined body fat percentage has differing associations with bone \nhealth and fracture s compared with BMI (8, 9) . Understanding these associations \ncould improve identification of older adults with obesity who are susceptible to poor \nmusculoskeletal health and improve provision of fracture prevention therapies in this \npopulation. \nSarcopenia is another condition that is common among older adults and is \ndefined as an age-associated loss of skeletal muscle mass and function (10-12). When \noccurring as a comorbid condition with obesity, ‘sarcopenic obesity’ may have severe \nconsequences for musculoskeletal health-related outcomes and increase the risk of \nfrailty and morbidity in older adults (10, 13) . A consensus definition for sarcopenic \nobesity has not yet been established, making it difficult for clinicians to diagnose this \ncondition and to understand its risk factors, prevalence, and outcomes among older \n\n 23 \nadults. Modifiable risk factors including physical activity, diet and socioeconomic \nstatus may predict the development of sarcopenic obesity but there is currently limited \nevidence on whether socioeconomic determinants including education, occupation \nand a rea of residence contribute to the prevalence of obesity, sarcopenia and \nsarcopenic obesity among older adults, and whether physical activity influences these \nassociations. \nLimited data from primarily Caucasian populations indicates that older adults \nwith sarcopenic obesity have poorer aBMD and up to three -fold higher rates of \nfractures compared with individuals with obesity alone and controls (without \nsarcopenia and obesity) (13-15). To date, data from prospective studies have not been \nsynthesised, and studies in ethnic populations are currently unavailable \nUnderstanding the effects of sarcopenic obesity on bone health and fracture risk in \ndiverse populations is important for developin g tailored interventions to prevent \ndisability in older adults. \nThis research program is comprised of two interlinked themes that 1) determine \nthe associations between socioeconomic status and sarcopenic obesity and 2) explore \nthe relationships between falls, fractures, bone health and sarcopenic obesity in older \nadults. These themes will be explored in five separate chapters which include cross -\nsectional and prospective observational studies in addition to a systematic review and \nmeta-analysis. \nThe first theme investigates associations between socioeconomic factors and \nsarcopenic obesity in Australian community-dwelling older adults. The second theme \nconsists of four chapters that separately (i) investigate risk factors associated with \nincident fractures am ong older individuals with and without obesity defined by both \nBMI and body fat percentage; (ii) compare falls risk and fracture rates, and aBMD, \n\n 24 \namong older adults with sarcopenic obesity to those without; (iii) determine sex -\nspecific differences in bone health among an ethnic population of older adults with \nsarcopenic obesity and; (iv) explore associations of components of obesity and \nsarcopenia with bone microarchitecture in older adults with obesity. Overall, this thesis \nrepresents the first broad investigation of clinical and physiological relationships of \nsarcopenic obesity with musculoskeletal health among older adults. This research \nprovides insights which can be translated into community-based programs and public \nhealth recommendations for older adults who are at risk of disability due to sarcopenic \nobesity. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 25 \nChapter 1.0 – Literature Review \n1.1 – Population ageing \nWorldwide p opulations of older adults are growing due to increased longevity and \nprogress in medical sectors (16, 17) . Advances in, and greater accessibility to, \nhealthcare services in the past two decades has promoted early diagnosis and timely \ntreatments for health conditions therefore reducing the risk of mortality and increasing \nlife expectancy (16, 18). Currently, there is no universally agreed definition for the \nterms ‘older adults’ although, the World Health Organisation classifies individuals aged \n60 years and above as older adults, this is not adaptable across certain countries (19, \n20). As such , for the purpose of this thesis, older adults will be used to describe \nindividuals aged 50 years and above. \nBy 2050, t he worldwide population of individuals aged 60 years and over is \nexpected to double to 2.1 billion (21). This may pose a significant burden to the \neconomic and healthcare sectors as ageing is associated with a progressive \ndegeneration of vital tissues and organs, which contributes to the development of \nmultiple chronic age-associated conditions (17, 21 -23). Chronic conditions with \nsignificant personal, economic, and societal burden are more prevalent in older adults \nand include obesity, certain types of cancer s, neurodegeneration, diabetes, \nosteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and several cardiovascular conditions (17, 24-27). As part \nof the normal ageing process, a cascade of underlying factors contributes to changes \nin many physiological and biological mechanisms increasing vulnerability to these \nconditions (22, 27-29). Specifically, changes in posture, balance, body composition, \nhormone levels, and inflammatory cytokines may increase the risk of frailty, morbidity, \nand institutionalisation among older adults (22, 28, 29) . These age-associated \nchanges are determined and influenced by genetic and environmental factors (23, 30, \n\n 26 \n31). A characteristic feature o f ageing is a decline in physical activity, as individuals \nbecome less active due to mobility restrictions (1, 32, 33). Declines in physical activity \nlead to a substantial reduction in overall energy expenditure , severely impactin g \nenergy balance and increasing the risk of adiposity and developing obesity in older \nadults (1, 32, 33). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 27 \n1.2 – Obesity in the ageing population \nThe term ‘obesity’ was officially recognised as a disease by the World Health \nOrganisation (WHO) in 1948 (34, 35). The prevalence of obesity continues to increase \nworldwide and is recognised as a global public health problem (36-39). Since 1975, \nobesity prevalence has approximately tripled and is forecasted to increase further over \nthe next two decades (40-43). By 2025, approximately 17 million Australians aged 20 \nyears and older are projected to be overweight or have obesity (44). This will have \nsevere economic ramifications in the coming years , with obesity-related costs \nestimated to rise to $21 billion by 2025 (45, 46). Obesity in older adults is associated \nwith severe health consequences including the development of diabetes, \ncardiovascular conditions, and certain cancer types all of which increase the risk of \ninstitutionalisation, multimorbidity, and mortality (1, 3, 47 ). Recent evidence has \ndemonstrated that obesity increases the risk of premature death by 1.45 to 2.76-fold \nand reduces life expectancy by up to 20 years (47, 48). \nNonetheless, obesity is common in older age; in 2017 -18, 46% of individuals \naged 18 to 24 years were overweight or had obesity, compared with 78% of individuals \naged 65 to 74 years (42). Ageing and obesity are closely related and share similar \nphenotypes (47). Age -related changes in body composition, reduced genomic \nintegrity, mitochondrial d ysfunction, compromised immunity and increased systemic \ninflammation increase the risk of developing obesity (47). Changes in body \ncomposition due to age leads to an increase in overall body fat, redistribution of fat \nfrom peripheral to subcutaneous regions , and increase in abdominal adipose tissue, \nall of which have consequences on overall health outcomes (49-51). Indeed, obesity \nin older adults is associated with increased risk of disability and poorer quality of life \n(52). \n\n 28 \nThe WHO c ategorises body size using the body mass index ( BMI) \nclassifications of underweight (BMI<18.5kg/m2), normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9kg/m2), \noverweight (BMI 25.0 -29.9kg/m2) and obesity ( BMI≥30kg/m2) (53). Although the se \nclassifications have been well established world -wide due to low cost and feasibility, \nwhether BMI is an accurate indicator of ob esity is currently debated (8, 9, 54, 55) . \nBody mass index is not reflective of adiposity as it is calculated using a height ( m2) \nand weight (kg) formula without accounting for body composition and may, therefore, \nunderestimate the prevalence of obesity (8, 9, 54-56). Individuals with the same BMI \nmay have different proportions of lean and fat mass (57). It is possible that the use of \nBMI to define obesity misclassifies those with excess body fat as being normal or \noverweight when in fact these individuals may be at increased risk of poor health \noutcomes (6, 8, 9). Likewise, those with normal fat mass with high lean mass may also \nbe incorrectly classified as having obesity, which may prompt unnecessary treatment \n(6). Several studies have demonstrated that the use of BMI alone is therefore \ninadequate for the proper diagnosis of those individuals at risk of high adiposity and \nadverse clinical outcomes (58-61). Some studies consider w aist circumference to \nbetter explain obesity-related health risks, morbidity and death compared to BMI (60-\n62). M easurement of waist circumference has been recommended , but it is less \ncommonly used in clinical practice than BMI (60-62). Waist circumference may be a \nmore accurate measure of fat distribution compared with BMI but may be more \nappropriate in identifying individuals with central obesity rather than general obesity \n(61-63). Abdominal obesity is defined as having a waist circumference of ≥88cm and \n≥102cm for women and men, respectively (61, 63). Recently, body fat percentage \nassessed by dual -energy X -ray absorptiometry (DXA) has been utilised to define \nobesity as it is one of the most precise and rel atively low -cost measures of body \n\n 29 \ncomposition and provides a direct estimate of relative adiposity (6, 64, 65). There is \nno consensus for defining obesity by body fat percentage but recent evidence has \nproposed that body fat percentages of >25% for men and >35% for women correspond \nto a BMI of 30kg/m2 (WHO classification of obesity) in Caucasians (6, 9, 66-69). There \nis a scarcity of evidence regarding cut -points for body fat percentage in ethnic \npopulations. Certain ethnic populations have a higher body fat percentage compared \nto Caucasians of the same age and BMI (70). It is important for future studies to \ndetermine optimal cut-points to understand the prevalence of obesity based on body \nfat percentage in ethnic populations of older adults. \nStudies have demonstrated that the use of body fat percentage may better \nassess and predict obesity and related outcomes such as ca rdiovascular conditions \nand diabetes than BMI or waist circumference (47, 54, 69, 71). However, it is important \nto note that the use of different definitions and cut-points have different effects on \nobesity prevalence and outcomes (47, 54, 69, 71) . In a study of 30,092 individuals \naged 45 to 85 years from the Canadian Longitudinal Study, prevalence varied based \non the definition of obesity used (71). This study demonstrated that the prevalence of \nobesity was lowest when defined by BMI (29%), followed by waist circumference \n(42%) with the highest prevalence by body fat percentage (73%) using cut-points of \n>25% for men and >35% for women (71). Similarly, a study of 451 individuals aged \n18 to 55 years reported that waist circumference and BMI underestimate the \nprevalence of obesity compared to body fat percentage (72). Recent e vidence \nindicates that instead of BMI to screen for obesity, the use of body fat percentage may \nprovide more accurate estimates of obesity prevalence (6, 54, 73) . In addition , \ndifferences in environmental, lifestyle and genetic factors are likely to contribute to \ndifferences in body composition and body size , therefore generalised body fat \n\n 30 \npercentage cut-points to define obesity cannot be utilised across diverse population s \n(58, 67, 74). It would therefore be beneficial to develop and utilise population-specific \ncut-points in order to understand the true burden of this disease in ethnic populations \n(58, 67, 74). However, in the absence of DXA in certain clinical settings, BMI or waist \ncircumference may be utilised as a screening tool for obesity. With increasing \nprevalence across the globe, understanding the negative repercussions of obesity is \ncrucial for early detection and treatment to reduce consequences associated with this \ncondition in diverse populations of older adults, who have increased risk for disability \ndue to obesity itself as well as other age-related conditions (75). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 31 \n1.3 – Sarcopenia \nThe term ‘sarcopenia’ was originally derived from the Greek ‘sarx’ (flesh) and \n‘penia’ (loss) to describe age -associated loss of skeletal muscle mass (11, 76, 77) . \nOvertime, the original definition of sarcopenia has evolved to incorporate age-related \ndeclines in both muscle mass and function (11, 76, 77). Some studies have argued \nthat muscle strength, rather than muscle mass, is a more reliable indicator of functional \nimpairment however, loss of bo th muscle mass and strength are important \ndeterminants of sarcopenia-related frailty (78). \nThe progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength has been attributed \nto age-related deterioration and alterations to a range of neurological, hormonal, and \nenvironmental pathways impairing physical activity, inflammation, nutrition, alpha -\nmotor units in the central nervous system and gene expression (78-81). Several of \nthese age-associated changes contribute to decreases in motor neurons, muscle fiber \nsize and number, contractility of fibers and an increase in fat infiltration causing \nimpairment to muscle quality (78, 80, 81) . Muscle quality is a vital component of \nsarcopenia, which is a term used to describe muscle composition including \nintramuscular fat infiltration and muscle fibres (82-84). Due to technological limitations, \nit is difficult to assess muscle quality in clinical settings (82). In addition, muscle power \nis another important component of sarcopenia, which is defined as the product of the \nforce and velocity of muscle contraction (85, 86). Muscle power is a component of \nphysical function which can be assessed clinically via a stair climb power test . \nEmerging longitudinal studies have reported that muscle mass and strength \ndecline as early as 30 years of age, with a more accelerated loss after the age of 60 \nyears (78, 87, 88) . The consequences of this loss of muscle mass and function are \noften severe in older adults and contribute to several adverse outcomes including \n\n 32 \nincreased disability, frailty and dependency (11). As such , sarcopenia is likely to \nimpose a significant burden to the economy and healthcare sectors (89, 90). A meta-\nanalysis of five studies including a total of 2,832 individuals aged 70 years and above \nreported that older adults with sarcopenia were at an increased risk of hospitalisation \n(hazard ratio (HR): 1.57; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.26, 1.94) compared to \nindividuals without sarcopenia (89). In addition, costs associated with sarcopenia were \nas high as United States dollar (USD) $26.2 billion (approximately Australian dollar \n(AUD) $36.5 billion) in 2004 , which is likely to increase further with the emerging \nprevalence of sarcopenia among older adults (91). Despite its significant negative \neffects, sarcopenia remains underdiagnosed and mismanaged due to lack of a clear \nconsensus definition (92). \nMuscle mass is often estimated from a whole -body DXA scan, by calculating \nappendicular lean mass (ALM), the sum of lean mass in the arms and legs (93). Most \nsarcopenia definitions utilise relative muscle m ass in the form of appendicular lean \nmass index (ALMI (kg/m2)), which is calculated as ALM (kg)/height (m 2) (93). Muscle \nstrength is widely assessed using hand grip strength measured by a handheld \ndynamometer, which is regarded as the most reliable measure of muscle function and \nthere is supporting evidence indicating that it is associated with relevant adverse \nhealth outcomes in older adults (82, 93, 94). Another commonly used assessment of \nmuscle funct ion in some sarcopenia definitions is gait speed , which is generally \nmeasured on a 4m walking course (82, 93, 95) . Previous research has found gait \nspeed to be associated with increased mortality and d isability in older adults and \ntherefore also considered an important marker for sarcopenia (82, 93). \nCurrently, there is no consensus definition for sarcopenia , with several \ndefinitions and different diagnostic criteria proposed (Table 1) (96). One of the most \n\n 33 \nwidely used sarcopenia definitions is the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in \nOlder People (EWGSOP) definition, which was recently revised with new cut -points \nfor low hand grip strength and ALMI (82). However, another recent definition from the \nSarcopenia Definitions and Outcomes Consortium (SDOC) defines sarcopenia based \non low hand grip strength, and low gait speed (95). In addition, t he revised Asian \nWorking Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) definition recommends measurement of low \nhand grip strength and ALMI for diagnosing sarcopenia in populations from Southeast \nAsian countries including China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, \nand Thailand (97). Sarcopenia prevalence estimates vary widely as they are \ndependent upon several factors includ ing age, sex, ethnicity, and the definition used \nand it can range from anywhere between 5 to 50% (96, 98). The lack of a consensus \ndefinition and uniform diagnostic criteria is a barrier to sarcopenia assessment and \nmanagement by clinicians and health professionals (92). Increasing knowledge and \nraising awareness among clinicians and health professional s may help prevent \nsubstantial loss of muscle mass and function and reduce the burden of sarcopenia \n(96). \n \n \n\n 34 \nTable 1.

This term was first proposed in 2000 to describe sarcopenia \naccompanied by adipose tissue hypertrophy (102). O lder adults with sarcopenic \nobesity have higher risk of disability, hospitalisation and mortality compared to those \nwith either sa rcopenia or obesity alone (13, 78, 99) . In individuals with sarcopeni c \nobesity there is a substantial increase in adipose tissue without a parallel increase in \nmuscle mass and strength, potentially resulting in individuals having physical capacity, \nwhich is insufficient to support the required movement and function of their body (78). \nSarcopenia and obesity synergistically increase the risk of negative health \noutcomes among older adults as they share similar pathophysiological factors \nincluding several lifestyle, hormonal and immunological mechanisms (79). Older \nadults with sarcopenic obesity undergo several changes in muscle composition \nincluding the infiltration of fat , which leads to a decrease in muscle quality and \nperformance (92). Although, evidence has shown that individuals with sarcopenic \nobesity report lower levels of physical activity and energy expenditure predisposing \nthem to increased risk of metabolic conditions and comorbidities, there is limited \nevidence on its associations with musculoskeletal health among older adults (93, 103). \nA study of 493 individuals (mean age of 53 years ) reported that sarcopenic obesity \nwas associated with insulin resistance (homeostatic model assessment of insulin \nresistance (HOMA-IR) score), inflammation (measured as C-reactive protein levels ) \nand vitamin D deficiency (104). In another study consisting of 3,366 community -\ndwelling older adults aged 65 years and older, sarcopenic obesity was associated with \na 23% higher risk of cardiovascular diseases (105). In the British Regional Heart Study \nincluding 4,252 men (age 60 to 79 years), those with sarcopenic obesity had higher \n\n 36 \nall-cause mortality risk (HR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.35, 2.18) compared to individuals with \nsarcopenia alone ( HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.22, 1.63) and obesity alone ( HR: 1.21; 95% \nCI: 1.03, 1.42) (106). These findings collectively demonstrate the negative \nrepercussions of sarcopenic obesity, particularly among older adults. \nSimilar to sarcop enia, the prevalence of sarcopenic obesity is expected to \nincrease globally due to the ageing population (79, 107, 108) . The prevalence of \nsarcopenic obesity ranges from 0 to 40% in older adults depending upon the \npopulation and diagnostic criteria applied (100, 109). Previously, studies have used \nseveral definitions of sarcopenic obesity, with combinations of obesity defined by BMI, \nwaist circumference or body fat percentage and sarcopenia defined by muscle mass, \nmuscle strength, or both (79, 100, 102). Several studies have previously utilised only \na measure of muscle mass and fat mass to define sarcopenic obesity (110-114). The \nprevalence of sarcopenic obesity when defined by muscle mass and fat mass ranged \nfrom 4 to 12% and among those studies that defined sarcopenic obesity based on \nhand grip strength and BMI, the prevalence ranged between 4 to 9% (78). This raises \nconcerns as there is compelling evidence from recent studies that sarcopenic obesity \nis determined by the deterioration of both muscle mass and function along with an \nincrease in fat, which synergistically leads to a higher risk for metabolic diseases and \nfunctional limitations (82, 115). To understand the true prevalence of this condition , \nsarcopenic obesity should be defined by both muscle mass and function and fat mass \nunlike the abovementioned studies. \nThe lack of a universal definition makes it difficult for clinicians to diagnose and \ntreat this condition among older adults (100). However, a consensus statement for the \ndiagnosis of sarcopenic obesity was recently proposed by the European Society for \nClinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) and the European Association for the \n\n 37 \nStudy of Obesity (EASO) (101). The joint consensus statement proposed that \nindividuals suspected of having sarcopenic obesity should be evaluated on two levels, \nwhich includes screening and diagnosis, with diagnosis further staged into two levels \nbeginning with the assessment of skeletal muscle functional parameters followed by \nan assessment of body composition assessed by DXA (101). This consensus \nstatement includes several cut-points for adiposity, muscle mass and function based \non ethnicity and gender making it difficult to achieve harmonisation of an operational \ndefinition (101). It is important to note that these criteria were based on expert opinion \nrather than being evidence-based (101). Studies are therefore required to validate \nthese cut-points in diverse populations so that diagnosis of sarcopenic obesity can be \nstandardised and easily examined by health professional s. Furthermore, having \nmultiple screening, diagnosing, and staging levels for sarcopenic obes ity may be \nchallenging in clinical settings (101). \nImportantly, although prevention and treatment strategies for sarcopenic \nobesity remain complex due to lack of universal definition, sarcopenic obesity is likely \nto be a modifiable condition (93, 116). Recent reviews have reported that prevention \nstrategies for sarcopenic obesity include adequate consumption of nutrients including \nvitamin D, calcium and protein for muscle mass and strength, and exercise training to \nbuild muscle strength and reduce fat mass (93, 117). A study of 62 older women with \na mean age of 68 years investigated the effects of a 12 -week resistance train ing \nprogram (1 or 3 sets per exercise) compared with controls (no exercise) on \ncomponents of sarcopenic obesity and bone density (118). This study demonstrated \nthat resistance training i mproved components of sarcopenic obesity , however a \nlimitation is that this analysis was performed in physically independent women and \nmay not be extrapolated to other populations or men (118). Further research is \n\n 38 \nrequired to investigate dietary and exercise interventions that are most effective in \nimproving body composition and physical function in older adults with sarcopenic \nobesity (119-121). This may be informed by studies which have identified risk factors \nfor sarcopenic obesity. \n\n 39 \n1.5 – Risk factors for sarcopenic obesity \nDecreases in muscle mass and function, and increased relative proportions of \nbody fat, are largely inevitable during ageing, but their rate, and whether they progress \nto cause disablement, is dependent upon many factors (92, 93, 122) . The present \ngrowth in obesity and sarcopenic obesity prevalence is attributed to the 'obesogenic' \nmodern environment (123-125). An environmental shift towards consumption of \nenergy-dense and nutrient poor foods, due to increased availability, accessibility and \naffordability, promotes excess energy intake and weight gain increasing the risk of \nobesity (125). In addition, r isk factors including genetics, sex, age-related body \ncomposition changes, ethnicity, socioeconomic inequality, smoking, alcohol intake, \nfood quality , hormone imbalance and physical activity may all be interrelated and \ntogether influence the risk of developing obesity, sarcopenia, and sarcopenic obesity \nin older adults (49, 126-130). There is a lack of evidence on how certain risk factors \nmay increase the risk of obesity, sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity among older \nadults. This thesis specifically examines socioeconomic status, physical activity, sex \nand ethnicity as potential risk factors for obesity, sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity \namong older adults. Understanding the pathogenic and underlying mechanisms of \nhow several risk factors contribute to gain in fat mass and/or loss of muscle mass and \nfunction may provide useful insights into the potential treatment and management of \nsarcopenic obesity among older adults. \nAge \nThe prevalence of obesity has markedly increased among older adults (1, 3). \nRecent evidence has demonstrated that obesity rates exceeded 37.5% and 39.4% in \nmen and women, respectively among individuals aged 60 years and more (3). \n\n 40 \nSimilarly, age-related biological changes drive sarcopenia which therefore makes age \na major risk factor (11, 131). In a recent study including 369 individuals aged 18 years \nand older, the prevalence of sarcopenia (defined by FNIH and having self -reported \nfunctional limitation) and sarcopenic obesity (FNIH and having self-reported functional \nlimitation with a BMI ≥30kg/m2) increased with age (132). The prevalence of \nsarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity was 4.25% and 3.28%, respectively among \nindividuals aged 18 to 39 years, 8.85% and 5.48%, respectively among individuals \naged 40 to 64 years and 15.51% and 6.98%, respectively among individuals aged 65 \nyears and older (132). These findings suggest that age is a significant contributor to \nthe development of sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity (79). \n \nGenetics \nObesity is a highly heritable condition, with estimated heritability ranging from \n40 to 70%, and has been found to be influenced by several genetic traits (133, 134). \nRecent evidence has reported a ten -fold higher risk of developing obesity if both \nparents have this condition and a four-fold higher risk if one parent has obesity (135). \nStudies have identified several genes and over 500 genetic loci associated with \nadiposity traits that contribute to the onset of obesity, its severity and distribution of fat \n(49, 133, 136) . A recent meta -analysis including 339,224 individuals demonstrated \nthat a range of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with BMI and \nobesity (137). In addition, uncoupling proteins (UCP) which are proteins that are found \nin the inner mitochondrial membrane have also been found to be associated with \nincreased risk of obesity (138). Allele variations of UCP, specifically, UCP1, UCP2 and \nUCP3 mutations decrease mitochondrial membrane potential, metabolic efficiency \nand energy expenditure consequently influencing body weight, BMI, and obesity (138). \n\n 41 \nLimited genetic studies have also confirmed a strong relation ship between \nmuscle mass and strength with hereditary , which may contribute to the development \nof sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity (139-141). It was estimated that the heritability \nof muscle strength could be anywhere between 30 to 80% and 50 to 80% for lea n \nmass (140). Recent studies have also found several genes linked to the development \nof sarcopenia and sarcope nic obesity , some of which include the genotypes of \nMTHFR, NRF2 and ACTN3 genes (140). These findings demonstrate that genetics \nplays a significant role in sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity in addition to age-related \nchanges or lifestyle mechanisms , which may account for the development and \nprogression of these conditions in older adults. \n \nSocioeconomic status \nSocioeconomic status is a major risk factor for unhealthy behaviours including \nphysical inactivity, which consequently increases the risk of adverse health outcomes, \nmorbidity, and mortality (142, 143). Education, social class, and income are the most \ncommonly operationalised determina nts of socioeconomic status and are key \npredictors of overall health (142, 144). However, there is no consensus on the nominal \ndefinition of socioeconomic status and the same indicators cannot be used between \ndeveloped and developing countries (145). For example , in developing countries, \nincome is poorly reported and may therefore be an unreliable indicator of \nsocioeconomic status whereas, income is an important determinant of socioeconomic \nstatus in developed countries (146). It is therefore important to develop more targeted \nand culturally acceptable determinants of socioeconomic status to better understand \nits implications across all countries. \n\n 42 \n Recent evidence has demonstrated that a higher level of education has been \nshown to improve health -related choices and health equity (142, 147) . Similarly, \noccupation/income contributes to better health outcomes and longer life expectancy \n(142, 147) . Some studies have also suggested that occupation may be another \nimportant determinant as occupation/ income allows for higher purchasing power for \nself-care and medical treatment contributing to better health outcomes and higher life \nexpectancy (142, 148). In addition, residing in advantaged areas is beneficial to an \nindividual’s health due to having better social support and access to health care \nservices compared to those residing in disadvantaged areas who have limited access \nto facilities including hea lth services (149). Recent evidence has demonstrated that \nobesity is more prevalent among socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals \nrepresented by determinants such as low income, education, or occupation type (150-\n152). In particular, in a study with 18,541 individuals aged 25 to 69 years, those with \nsocioeconomic inequalities demonstrated a higher prevalence of obesity (152). Due \nto financial constraints and limited access to healthy food, socioeconomically \ndisadvantaged individuals are more prone to consuming energy -dense, nutrient-poor \ndiets, which is one of the key contributors to obesity (153). Additionally, indi viduals \nwith socioeconomic inequalities are predisposed to unhealthy behaviours such as \nsmoking, alcohol consumption and poor physical activity - all of which may further \ncontribute to increased weight gain and ultimately obesity (154, 155). \nSeveral studies have demonstrated that economically stable older adults with \nbetter education and income have a lower prevalence of sarcopenia compared to \nthose with socioeconomic disadvantages (147, 149, 156, 157) . A recent study \nconsisting of 6,081 individuals with a mean age of 41.3 years reported that individuals \nwith low household income (OR: 1.637; 95% CI: 1.159, 2.312) and low er education \n\n 43 \n(OR: 2.351; 95% CI: 1.629, 3.394) had poorer hand grip strength compared to \nindividuals with advantaged socioeconomic status (158). However, there are limited \nstudies investigating the associations between socioeconomic determinants and \nsarcopenic obesity (147, 159-161). It has been established that socioeconomic status \ninfluences obesity and sarcopenia, however its effects on sarcopenic obesity are \nscarce among older adults. The relationship between socioeconomic status and \nsarcopenic obesity needs to be investigated to ensure the prevention of this condition \nand to maintain quality of life with ageing in this at -risk population. A study of 1,765 \nindividuals residing in Spain aged 65 years and older found no associations between \nsocioeconomic status and sarcopenic obesity (147). In this study , individuals in the \nlower two quintiles of ALMI and body fat percentage were classified as having \nsarcopenic obesity (147). Conversely, in a study of 10,325 individuals from Louisiana, \nUSA with mean age of 54 years, income and education were significantly associated \nwith sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity (160). In this study, income was significantly \nassociated with sarcopenic obesity, as men with an annual income of less than \n$20,000 were 2.78 times more likely to have sarcopenic obesity compared with those \nmen with an annual income of $60,000 or more (160). Similarly, women with a high \nschool and/or some college education were 2.68 times more likely to have sarcopenic \nobesity compared with women with at least a college degree (160). Sarcopenia in the \nabovementioned study was defined as one standard deviation below the gender -\nspecific means (cut-points for men: <7.8kg/m2; women: <5.88kg/m2) and obesity was \ndefined by waist -to-hip ratio (cut -points for men: ≥90; women: ≥0.85) (160). \nDifferences in demographics, physical activity levels, body composition and the \ndefinition of sarcopenic obesity used in the two studies mentioned above could have \ncontributed to the differences in associations between socioeconomic status and \n\n 44 \nsarcopenic obesity. In addition, lack of physical activity or inability to exercise due to \nsocioeconomic inequalities is another contributor that may play a role in the \ndevelopment of sarcopenia, though research on its effects on sarcopenic obesity are \nlimited (158). There is therefore a greater need for more studies on effects of \nsocioeconomic inequalities on sarcopenic obesity and to investigate whether physical \nactivity influences these associations. \n \nSmoking and alcohol consumption \nSmoking increases the risk of obesity as heavy smokers have high BMI (162). A \nstudy of 499,504 adults aged 31 to 69 years reported that among smokers, the risk of \nobesity increased with the number of cigarettes smoked (163). Some studies have \nalso examined the associations between smoking and sarcopenia (164-166). In a \nstudy of 845 men aged 45 to 85 years, it was reported that smokers had lower relative \nappendicular skeletal muscle mass (167). However, there are limited studies on the \neffects of smoking on sarcopenic obesity. A cross-sectional study of 9,385 individuals \naged 50 years and more reported that heavy smokers were more likely to have \nsarcopenic obesity (OR: 9.53; 95% CI: 1.65, 55.01) (164). Additionally, the biological \nmechanisms for t he effects of smoking on sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity are \ncurrently unclear. Nevertheless, a proposed mechanism for the effects of smoking on \nmuscle is that the volatile components of cigarettes including aldehydes, reactive \noxygen species and reactiv e nitrogen species, which enter via the blood stream into \nthe skeletal muscle increasing oxidative stress leading to protein degradation \naccelerating the progression of sarcopenia among older adults (168). \n\n 45 \nExcess alcohol intake also has adverse effects on health and has been \nattributed to increased body weight and obesity (169, 170). In 8,864 individuals aged \n17 years and older, obesity risk was 70% higher for heavy drinkers compared with \nlight drinkers (169, 171). Evidence suggests that alcohol consumption increases food \nintake due to its effects on a number of hormones linked to satiety such as leptin (172). \nAside from increased appetite, alcohol also influences energy storage as it inhibits fat \noxidation with excess intake of alcohol regularly leading to fat sparing, increasing body \nfat over time (169). Although the effects of alcohol on weight gain and obesity have \nbeen studied extensively, whether alcohol consumption is a risk factor for sarcopenia \nand sarcopenic obesity remains poorly investigated. Excess ethanol may promote the \ninhibition of muscle protein synthesis and also simultaneously increase muscle \nautophagy (173, 174) . In the Dementia Research Grou p, a multicentre population -\nbased study of individuals aged 65 years and older, moderate alcohol drinking was \nsignificantly associated with sarcopenic obesity (OR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.21, 2.57) but not \nsarcopenia (OR: 1.21; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.62) (173). In contrast, a meta -analysis of 13 \nstudies including 13,155 individuals has reported alcohol drinking is not a risk factor \nfor sarcopenia (OR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.67 -0.88) (175). There are, however, a few \nlimitations in this meta -analysis as the relationship between drinking pattern and \nsarcopenia was not confirmed. In addition, none of the studies included in the meta -\nanalysis had a primary focus on the associations between alcohol consumption and \nsarcopenia (175). \n \n \n \n\n 46 \nSex \n The prevalence of obesity among men and women differs; obesity generally is \nmore prevalent in women compared with men (170, 176-179). In a study conducted \namong 3,799 individuals aged 30 to 70 years, a larger proportion of women ( 39.5%) \nhad obesity compared with men (14.5%) when defined by BMI≥30kg/m 2 (180). Sex \ndifferences in mobilisation and distribution of adipose tissue storage, insulin sensitivity, \nlipoprotein profiles, gonadal hormones, and physical activity may explain differences \nin obesity prevalence (170, 176 -178). In p articular, the menopause transition in \nwomen leads to a shift in hormonal levels with a substantial loss of estrogen \nproduction, which is associat ed with an increase in fat mass, fat redistribution and \neventually weight gain , contributing to adverse health outcomes (181, 182) . In \naddition, men are also more likely to be physically active and engage in higher levels \nof physical activity compared to women, which could also explain disparities in obesity \nprevalence (162, 170, 183, 184). \nMany studies have also demonstrated that the onset of functional decline and \nmuscle mass loss differs among m en and women (12, 185, 186). Overall, men have \na faster deterioration of muscle mass even though they have more initial muscle mass \ncompared with women (185). Substantial decrease s in testosterone and insulin-like \ngrowth factor ( IGF)-1 levels are some of the main contributors to this observed \nincreased risk of sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity among men compared to women \n(185). In contrast, a longitudinal study of 4,000 community-dwelling older adults aged \n>64 years stated that women had -2.02% loss of ALM but men had -1.59% loss of \nALM after four years (187). There are contradictory findings regarding the prevalence \nof sarcopenia, with s ome studies reporting the prevalence to be higher among men \n\n 47 \ncompared to women while, others have stated the opposite (96, 185, 188-190). These \ndisparities in prevalence may be explained by differences in sarcopenia definitions or \ndue to ethnicity-related differences in genetics, lifestyles, body composition, physical \nactivity and fat distribution (188). Understanding these disparities can benefit future \ntrials to develop sex -specific interventions to reduce the risk of sarcopenic obesity \namong this population of older adults. \nIn a cross-sectional study of 631 community-dwelling older adults aged over 65 \nyears in East China, the prevalence of sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity was higher \nin men (19.2% and 7.0% , respectively) compared to women (8.6% and 2.4%, \nrespectively) (185). A strength of this study was that sarcopenia was defined based \non the AWGS definition. However, a limitation was that participants with obesity were \nrequired to have a body fat percentage above the 60th percentile of the study sample \nof the same sex, which corresponded to 27.2% for men and 35.9% for women (185). \nThe cut-points used in this study may not be comparable with other studies and the \nuse of this definition could have influenced the prevalence of sarcopenic obesity in this \npopulation (185). In contrast, a cross-sectional study in 119,494 individuals aged 18 \nto 90 years from the Dutch Lifelines cohort study reported that the prevalence of \nsarcopenic obesity was 0.9% in men and 1.4% in women (191). In this study, women \nhad a higher prevalence of sarcopenic obesity com pared to men in all age groups \n(191). These findings are limited as the definition of obesity was based on the WHO \nBMI cut-points and sarcopenia was defined by 24-hour urine creatinine excretion to \nmeasure muscle mass (191). In addition to these contradictory findings, there are very \nlimited studies evaluating sex-differences in the prevalence of sarcopenic obesity in \ncertain ethnic populations of older adults. \n \n\n 48 \nEthnicity \nMany studies have demonstrated ethnic differences in health outcomes during \nthe ageing process (192-195). Some ethnic groups are predisposed to poorer health \noutcomes during ageing compared with those of Caucasian descent, such as \nincreased risk of chronic diseases, functional limitations, morbidity, and mortality (192, \n193, 196). In a study involving 236,289 older adults with a mean age of 74 years , it \nwas demonstrated that individuals of diverse ethnic backgrounds were at a higher risk \nfor adverse health outcomes such as obesity and chronic conditions compared with \nnon-Hispanic Whites (196). There are several potential reasons contributing to this \nincreased risk of poor overall health in certain ethnic groups, and include differences \nin: metabolism, body composition, genetics, environment, and lifestyle factors (192, \n197-199). Recent evidence demonstrates that certain ethnic populations may also be \nmore susceptible to obesity (58, 200). A study of 47,970 individuals aged 18 years and \nolder reported that being Hispanic (odds ratio (OR): 1.47; 95% confidence interval (CI): \n1.31, 1.65) and Black (OR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.65, 2.53) were associated with higher odds \nof obesity compared with Whites. However, being Chinese (OR: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.18, \n0.45), Korean (0.14; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.46), and Vietnamese (OR: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.14, \n0.58) were all associated with lower odds of obesity compared with Whites (201). In \nthis study however, obesity was defined by Asian BMI cut-points and the use of body \nfat percentage may affect obesity prevalence (201). On average, most Asian \nethnicities have greater average body fat percentage compared with Whites of the \nsame age and BMI (70). This was evident in a study with 115 Chinese and 114 White \nmen aged 28 to 63 years, where Chinese men had more total body fat and central fat \ncompared with White men (58). In a nother population-based study which included \n21,399 adults aged 20 years and older, Asian populations had changes in body \n\n 49 \ncomposition over time as a significant increase in body fat percentage was observed \namong non-Hispanic Asians from 25.5% (2011 to 2012) to 28.2% (2017 to 2018), but \nremained stable among other ethnic groups (Hispanic, non-Hispanic White, non-\nHispanic Black) (202). Although this study investigated longitudinal changes in body \nfat percentage in different ethnic populations , the differences in obesity prevalence \nbased on body fat percentage cut-points was not investigated (202). Therefore, further \nresearch is necessary to explore the differences in the prevalence of obesity defined \nby body fat percentage in various ethnic populations. \nSimilarly, there are ethnic differences in sarcopenia components as previous \nresearch demonstrat ed disparities in muscle mass, strength, and function between \ndifferent ethnic groups (197-199, 203). The rate of decline in muscle strength with age \nis much more rapid in Asian populations compared with Caucasians and other ethnic \ngroups, along with a greater deterioration in muscle function (187, 199). A recent study \nincluding 10,325 individuals with a mean age of 54 years reported that sarcopenia \nprevalence was highest in Asian men (40.6%) and women (30.1%) (160). In this \nstudy, the prevalence of sarcopenic obesity was also highest in Asian m en (14.4%) \nand women (8.0%) whereas, it was the lowest among Black men (3.7%) and women \n(0.9%) (160). Sarcopenia was defined based on one standard deviation below the \ngender-specific means of height-adjusted appendicular skeletal muscle mass with cut-\npoints of <7.8kg/m2 for men and <5.88kg/m 2 for women (160). Although this study \ninvestigated sarcopenic obesity in populations including African -American/Black, \nAsians, Caucasian/White, and Hispanic/Latino, studies in specific ethnic populations \nof low to middle income countries such as India are currently scarce (160). The Asian \ncontinent consists of 48 countries and each of these sub -populations have different \nlifestyles and environmental f actors including culture, food consumption, body \n\n 50 \ncomposition, physical activity, and socioeconomic status - all of which may contribute \nto differences in sarcopenic obesity prevalence (204-206). As such, demographic \ngroups should be individually assessed to determine the prevalence and effects of \nsarcopenic obesity in various populations unlike the abovementioned study , which \ngrouped all Asian countries together (160). \n \nDiet \nDiet behaviours play a major role in the development of obesity, sarcopenia \nand sarcopenic obesity and are likely to be key in their management (93, 98, 141) . \nWeight gain is often caused by an imbalance in energy intake and expenditure due to \nincreased sedentary behaviours and poor dietary consumption including excessive \nintake of energy-dense and high fat diets (182, 207, 208). Increased availability and \naccessibility of fast foods stimulates excessive intake of high -calorie, low -nutrient \nfoods, increasing the risk of obesity and sarcopenic obesity (208). \nVitamin D, or more specifically its metabolite 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), \nhas been identified as an important nutrient contributing to adverse musculoskeletal \noutcomes and also the development of obesit y, sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity \n(98, 209). Vitamin D deficiency, defined as 25(OH)D blood concentrations of less than \n50nmol/L can be treated through vitamin D supplements but can also be obtained \nthrough exposure to sunlight and diet (210, 211). Insufficient vitamin D levels modulate \ninflammatory response s, affect adipogenesis and accumulating evidence indicates \nthat low vitamin D levels are associated with an increased risk of obesity (212-214). \nLikewise, severe vitamin D deficiency has also been found to cause muscle weakness \nand pain particularly in the lower limbs among older adults (210). Skeletal muscle is \n\n 51 \nseverely affected by low vitamin D levels due to its contribution to the function of fast-\ntwitch type II muscle fibres (210, 211). Muscle contractions and power are controlled \nby type II muscle fibers, and vitamin D deficiency is linked to muscle fibre atrophy \nconsequently compromising muscle health and function (210, 215, 216) . Therefore, \nadequate concentrations of v itamin D may be important for physical performance , \nmuscle health and reducing risk of adverse musculoskeletal outcomes (210). \nIn addition , p rotein is another important nutrient that is associated with \nsarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity , as proteins stimulate the synthesis of muscle \nproteins (209, 217). Several studies have identified that adequate protein intake is \nconsistently associated with better muscle health among older adults (209, 218-221). \nThe recommended dietary protein intake for all adults over the age of 18 years \nincludes 0.8 g/kg/day, however this recommendation is currently under debate (218). \nAccording to some studies, to counteract age-associated losses of muscle mass, older \nadults may require a higher protein intake with approximately 1 -1.25g/kg/day (222-\n224). It has been estimated that a large proportion of adults (38% of men and 41% of \nwomen) have dietary intakes below the recommended daily allowance making them \nsusceptible to increased risk of sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity (218, 220). A study \nconsisting of 18 women aged 41 to 74 years found that individuals with sarcopenic \nobesity showed improvements in body composition and muscle strength ( improved \nhand grip strength by 1.6kg) after consuming a high-protein diet for four months (1.2-\n1.4g/kg/day) (225). However, these findings are limited as the sample size was small \n(225). Further research is needed to determine the most effective dietary protein intake \nto prevent sarcopenic obesity in older adults. \n \n \n\n 52 \nPhysical activity \nPhysical activity and exercise are recommended as one of the most effective \nmeans to prevent and manage several diseases including obesity, sarcopenia and \nsarcopenic obesity, particularly among older adults (226-231). Physical inactivity and \nincreased sedentary behaviours have emerged as major risk factor s for higher levels \nof disability and all -cause mortality among older adults (232). Modern-day lifestyles \nare characterised by sedentary behaviour, which is the main contributor to increased \nrisk of obesity (233). Alarmingly, one in four adults in USA spend approximately 70% \nof their waking hours sitting (233). This shift in increased sedentary behaviour results \nfrom increased television viewing, working from home and commuting to work by car, \nthereby decreasing overall locomotion and energy expenditure (233). In a cross -\nsectional study of 162 community -dwelling older adults aged 60 years and older, an \nincrement of one hour in overall sitting time was associated with a greater risk for \nsarcopenia (226). There are multiple mechanisms by which p rolonged sedentary \nbehaviours and reduced energy expenditure increase the risk of sarcopenia and \nsarcopenic obesity (234, 235). Sedentary behaviour results in fewer skeletal muscle \ncontractions, which decreases lipoprotein lipase activity and triglyceride clearance and \nalso result s in poor glucose -stimulated insulin secretion (233). In addition, l ack of \nmuscle contractions causes an infiltration of fat, which is associated with poor muscle \nmass, power, quality, function, and strength therefore increasing the risk of sarcopenic \nobesity (80, 226, 236) . In a study of 871 older adults aged 65 years and older \nproinflammatory cytokines were associated with the development of sarcopenic \nobesity causing mobility limitations (78, 237) . P rolonged periods of sedentary \nbehaviour leads to changes in hormonal levels (including testosterone, IGF -1, \nmyostatin and tumour necrosis factor -alpha ( TNF-α) and neural activity (including \n\n 53 \nmotor unit denervation), which also contributes to developing sarcopenic obesity (226, \n238). \nMuscle impairment due to age -associated mobility limitation s may lead to \nfluctuations in metabolic rate , which may also aggravate sedentary behaviour , \nresulting in weight gain and subsequent sarcopenic obesity (78). Therefore, the effects \nof physical activity on sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity may be cyclic as these \nconditions also contribute to further reductions in physical activity (239). \nStudies have demonstrated that physical activity may reduce the risk of \ndeveloping sarcopenic obesity among older adults (240, 241) . In a study including \n3,367 older adults aged 65 years and older, higher levels of physical activity were \nassociated with a 55% and 29% lower risk of developing sarcopenic obesity in men \nand women, respectively (240, 241). Physical activity should be encouraged among \nolder adults to prevent the risk of developing sarcopenic obesity and its negative \nrepercussions.\n\n 54 \n1.6 – Bone and muscle health \n1.6.1 Osteoporosis \nOsteoporosis is a global public health problem among older adults and is \ncharacterised by severe loss of bone mass and bone microarchitectural deterioration \n(242, 243) . Osteoporosis is defined using areal bone mineral density (aBMD) \nassessed by DXA , which generates an output of T-score (a measure of standard \ndeviation, which calculates bone density compared with what is usually expected in a \nhealthy young adult) (244). Osteopenia is often a precursor to osteoporosis and is a \nmilder form of bone loss , which is defined as having a T -score between -1 and -2.5, \nwhile osteoporosis is defined as having a T-score of ≤-2.5 at the total hip and lumbar \nspine (245-247). \nApproximately 10 million Americans aged 50 years and older had osteoporosis \nin 2020, and with the increased ageing of populations, the prevalence of osteoporosis \nis expected to rise further (248). In a recent systematic review and meta -analysis of \nolder adults, including 40 studie s from around the world, with a total sample size of \n79,127 individuals , the highest prevalence of osteoporosis was reported in Asia \n(24.3%), followed by Europe (16.7%) and was the lowest in USA (11.5%) (249). \nTherefore, it is clear that the prevalence of osteoporosis differs according to ethnicity \n(250-252). \nAge-related loss of bone mass increases the risk of fractures, morbidity, and \nhospitalisation (29, 51, 253, 254) . The annual cost of osteopenia, osteoporosis , and \nrelated fractures in Austral ians was AUD $4.3 billion in 2020 (255). Costs related to \ntreatment for falls, fracture s and poor bone health is expected to substantially rise \nwithin the coming years (255). \n\n 55 \nObesity has a complex relationship with bone health (4). Individuals with \nobesity are less likely to be screened for osteoporosis or receive bone protective \nmedications (256, 257). In the Global Longitudinal study of Osteoporosis in Women \n(GLOW) study including 60,393 individuals aged 55 years and older, among women \nwith obesity, only 27% of those with incident fractures were receiving bone protective \nmedications as opposed to 41% and 57% among those with normal weight and \nunderweight, respectively (257). Although, t his is likely due to evidence that body \nweight is positively associated with higher aBMD , DXA tends to overestimate bone \nhealth in these individuals (258-261). A study consisting of 3,296 individuals aged 50 \nyears and older reported an increase in 0.0082g/cm2 in aBMD for every unit increase \nin BMI (7). Likewise, in another study including 358 men aged between 50 and 89 \nyears, there was a positive relationship between aBMD at all sites (including lumbar \nspine, femoral neck, and total hip) and BMI (all p<0.05) (262). As such, high BMI is \nconsidered to have a protective effect on bone mass potentially resulting in bone \nhealth in this population being neglected by health professionals (257, 263, 264). \nBMI is not nece ssarily representative of adiposity, and that fat mass per se is \nnot beneficial for bone health (8, 263) . Recent evidence suggests other indices of \nobesity, such as DXA-determined body fat percentage, may be negatively associated \nwith aBMD and detrimental to bone health (7, 8, 265, 266) . This was confirmed in a \nstudy of 1,992 adults with a mean age of 48.7 years , which reported a negative \ncorrelation between aBMD and body fat percentage in Korean men and women (265). \nFurther, a study in 173 individuals with obesity aged 65 years and more showed that \nhigher adiposity (DXA -determined fat mass) was associated with lower aBMD and \nhigher adipokine levels increasing frailty (267). Likewise, a study in 6,776 individuals \naged 20 years and older showed that higher body fat percentage was associated with \n\n 56 \nreduced aBMD , particularly among men (268). Excess body fat contributes to an \nincrease in pro -inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (Il) -1β, Il -6 and TNF -α \npromoting osteoclast activity, bone resorption therefore decreasing bone mass and \nimpairing overall bone health (4, 266). Individuals with higher fat mass have also been \nreported to have higher levels of serum parathyroid hormone ( main regulator of \ncalcium homeostasis) , which causes bone resorption and has negative effects on \naBMD (4, 269). Further research is required to determine the associations of obesity, \nassessed by direct measures of body fat, with bone health in older adults. \nBone and muscle interact with each other mechanically and metabolically \n(242). Recent evidence suggests that t here may be a potential interconnection \nbetween osteoporosis, sarcopenia, and obesity as there are shared risk factors for the \ndevelopment of these conditions (Figure 1) (270-272). The co-morbid presence of \nthese conditions is common among older adults due to age-related changes in several \nmechanisms including changes to body composition and hormonal levels , which \npromote the simultaneous loss of bone and muscle mass along with an increase in fat \nmass (270-272). However, a higher proportion of women are expected to have the \ncombined presence of sarcopenic obesity and osteoporosis due to ovarian hormone \ndeficiency as part of ageing , which leads to substantial negative implications on \nmusculoskeletal outcomes (270). As previously stated, estrogen deficiency plays a \nboth direct and indirect role in increasing fat mass and promotes the simultaneous loss \nof both bone and muscle mass among older women (270). \nStudies have demonstrated that sarcopenic obesity increases the risk of \nosteoporosis among older adults (114, 273, 274). In a cross-sectional study of 7,449 \nKorean individuals aged 50 years and more , those with sarcopenic obesity had an \n\n 57 \neight-fold higher likelihood for osteoporosis compared with those without sarcopenia \nor obesity (13, 114). Similarly, in a study including 183 New Zealanders with a mean \nage of 73 years showed that the prevalence of osteoporosis was approximately two-\nfold greater in individuals with sarcopenic obesity compared to individuals with obesity \nalone (273, 275). Likewise, in a study of 1,089 individuals residing in Australia with a \nmean age of 62 years, individuals with sarcopenic obesity (low muscle mass with high \nfat mass) and dynapenic obesity (low muscle strength with high fat mass) had a higher \nprevalence for osteoporosis/osteopenia compared with those with obesity alone (275). \nEven though each of the abovementioned studies evaluated the associations between \nsarcopenic obesity and bone health in various populations, there is still a paucity of \nresearch on whether sarcopenic obesity increases the risk of osteoporosis in specific \nethnic commu nities. Therefore, m ore research is required to understand the \ndifferences in sarcopenic obesity among different ethnic groups , as genetic and \nenvironmental variables related to poor aBMD and osteoporosis may put specific \npopulations at a higher risk of adverse health outcomes. \nSeveral technical advances in novel imaging modalities have increased the \naccuracy of diagnosing musculoskeletal-related conditions among older adults (276). \nDXA is a two -dimensional measure of aBMD and is the current gold standard for \ndiagnosing osteoporosis among older adults (5, 277). Osteoporosis is associated with \ncompromised bone strength and microarchitecture – both of which DXA cannot \naccount for, as it cannot distinguish between cortical and trabecular bone (244, 278). \nIn addition, aBMD may cause a scaling artifact, which inaccurately estimates smaller \nbones as having lower aBMD and may therefore misclassify individuals with short \nstature as having osteoporosis (279). Bone mineral apparent density (BMAD) \ncalculated as aBMD/√bone area accounts for short stature, which should be used to \n\n 58 \navoid overdiagnosis of osteoporosis (280). Utilising BMAD may help account for the \nsize of bones to reduce the risk of ethnic-specific discrepancies as the average height \namong Asians is much lower compared with Caucasian populations, which may \ninfluence the differences in aBMD and osteoporosis prevalence (279-282). In the Early \nPostmenopausal Interventional Cohort study including 1,367 Caucasian and 162 \nAsian women aged between 45 to 59 years, aBMD in Asian women was 4.6% lower \nthan in Caucasian women without any differences in aBMD once adjusted for height \n(283, 284). As a result, this study emphasises the importance of accounting for body \nsize when evaluating the ethnic differences in aBMD (284). \n Although, DXA is a commonly used imaging modality to measure aBMD, it has \nbeen found to be less accurate among individuals with obesity due to excess soft \ntissue (256). Specifically, layering of fat at the lumbar spine site leads to inaccuracies \nin aBMD measurement. In contrast to DXA, high -resolution peripheral quantitative \ncomputed tomography (HR -pQCT) is a novel three -dimensional assessment of the \nbone microarchitecture and volumetric BMD (vBMD) , which distinguishes between \ncortical and trabecular bone parameters (285, 286) . HR -pQCT would therefore be \nutilised to assess bone health among older adults as it provides data on bone quality, \ngeometry and strength , which will contribute to improving fracture risk in individuals \nwith sarcopenic obesity . However, there are certain challenges and limitations with \nHR-pQCT (287). Firstly, scans can only be performed at two peripheral skeletal sites \n(radius and tibia) (287). Also, HR -pQCT is highly sensitive to motion artifacts and \ntherefore cannot be performed on extremely frail and fragile individuals (287). In \naddition, HR-pQCT cannot be used as a screening tool for poor bone health, as its \ncurrently prohibitive costs prevent them from being widely available in clinical settings \n(287).\n\n 59 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Shared risk factors for sarcopenia, obesity, and osteoporosis. Asterisks (*) indicates risk factors investigated in this thesis. \nAbbreviations: SES, socioeconomic status.\n\n\n 60 \n1.6.2 Falls and fractures \nFalls are a leading contributor to hospitalisation and injury death among \nAustralian older adults , with 43% of hospitalised injuries and 39% of injury deaths \nreported due to falls in 2018 -19 (288, 289). Previous literature has demonstrated a \nnumber of risk factors including age, fear of falling, multimorbidity, psychological stress \nand physical weakness, which may predispose older adults to a greater risk of falls \n(255, 290). Falls are associated with several detrimental effects on older adults as \nthey lead to increased risk of physical disability, functional impairment, dependency in \ndaily activities and institutionalisation (290). Falls are one of the main causes of \nfractures among older adults, increasing morbidity and mortality, which places a \nsubstantial economic healthcare burden (257). One in three women aged 50 years \nand over will sustain a fracture during their lifetime, which accumulates to an estimated \nannual cost of USD $17 billion (approximately AUD $23 billion) in USA (257). \nSome studies have reported that o lder adults with obesity have an increased \nrisk of fall s (291, 292). In the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men study , including 5,834 \nindividuals aged 65 years and above , the falls rate was lowest in the youngest and \nnormal weight men but highest among the oldest men with the highest BMI (292). \nAnother study of 226 women aged between 60 to 80 years reported that individuals \nwith obesity had a greater probability of falls compared to normal weight women (293). \nThis overall higher r isk of falls among individuals with obesity may be due to the \ndistribution of fat impacting balance and postural sway (294). This was confirmed in a \nstudy consisting of 280,035 adults aged 45 to 79 years, as the risk of falling in the \nprevious 12 months was higher among those with obesity compared to those without \nobesity (295). Individuals with obesity have a greater fear of falling, which may lead to \n\n 61 \na reduction in physical activity and subsequent functional impairment , together \ncontributing to the increased falls risk (294). \nFractures are also common among older adults with obesity despite a \nperception that individuals with obesity are protected against fractures due to high \naBMD and increased soft -tissue padding (257, 296) . Recent findings have \ndemonstrated that older adults with obesity (defined by BMI) have an increased risk \nof fractures, particularly at peripheral sites (297). In the aforementioned GLOW study, \na prospective study of 60,393 women aged 50 years and older, fractures in women \nwith obesity accounted for 23% of previous fractures and 22% of incident fractures \n(257, 264). This study also found that the risk of fractures at the ankle and upper leg \nwas significantly higher among those with obesity compared to those women without \nobesity (257, 264). This increased risk of site -specific fractures among older adults \nwith obesity may partly be explained by poorer bone microarchitecture and higher falls \nrisk (285, 297-299). However, there is a scarcity of research investigating the effects \nof obesity on bone microarchitecture among older adults. Conversely, n umerous \nstudies have reported obesity to be protective against hip fractures (256, 300-303). \nHowever, in the Million Women Study, a prospective study of 925,345 women (mean \nage of 57 years) in the United Kingdom, almost half of all postmenopausal hip fractures \noccurred in women who were overweight or had obesity (300). This discrepancy could \nbe due to the fact th at obesity was defined by body fat percentage in the Million \nWomen Study but by BMI in studies that found a protective effe ct for hip fractures \n(256, 300-303). As previously stated, evidence demonstrates that unlike BMI, body fat \npercentage is negatively associated with bone health, therefore challenging the use of \nBMI to define obesity (Figure 2) (265, 304). There is a lack of evidence to support the \n\n 62 \nfact that different obesity definitions have varied effects on musculoskeletal health \noutcomes such as fractures and bone microarchitecture requiring further investigation. \nSarcopenia may further exacerbate the risk of falls and fractures among those \nwith obesity (13). The dual effects of weakness from sarcopenia and the need to carry \nexcess weight from obesity lead to increased risk of poor physical function and \nmobility, which may predispose these individuals to a greater risk of falls and fractures \n(14, 15, 305 -307). Although, multiple studies have investigated the associations \nbetween ageing and falls and fractures, there is limited evidence on whether olde r \nadults with sarcopenic obesity represent a subset of the population who are at an \nincreased risk of these adverse outcomes. \nStudies in primarily Caucasian populations have demonstrated that individuals \nwith sarcopenic obesity had poorer aBMD and a three-fold increased risk of falls and \nfractures compared to those with obesity alone and controls (without sarcopenia and \nobesity) (14, 15, 306). In addition, in a prospective cohort study of 11,020 multiethnic \ncohort women, sarcopenic obesity was associated with a greater risk of falls compared \nwith controls (307). In another study with 598 individuals aged 65 to 98 years from the \nGeelong Osteoporosis Study, falls were more common among those with sarcopenic \nobesity (40.6%) compared to those without (26.8%). The combination of sarcopenia \nand obesity increases the risk of fractures in older adults as both sarcopenia and \nobesity increase falls risk (13). In a study of 1,089 individuals with a mean age of 62 \nyears, it was evident that women with sarcopenic obesity had higher fracture rates \ncompared with individuals with obesity alone (incidence rate ratios: 2.82; 95% CI: 1.42, \n5.60) (275). Reduction in muscle mass and weakness in muscle strength from \nsarcopenia and the effects of additional weight on bones due to obesity, negatively \ncontributes to body stability increasing the risk of frailty and fractures (308). Several \n\n 63 \nmechanisms including elevated proinfla mmatory factors, hormonal imbalance , poor \nphysical function, and poor bone microarchitecture may increase the risk of falls and \nfractures among individuals with sarcopenic obesity (123, 307). However, there is a \nscarcity of research on the factors that contribute to this increased falls and fracture \nrisk in this group of older adults . In the absence of specific therapies for the \nmanagement of sarcopenic obesity, further research is required to understand these \nfactors, which will aid in the development of effective interventions to prevent falls and \nfractures in this high-risk population (309, 310). \n\n 64 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2. Associations between musculoskeletal health and obesity defined by BMI vs body fat percentage .

Several factors \nincluding age, sex, genetics, enviro nmental and lifestyle factors may influence the \ndevelopment, progression and severity of sarcopenic obesity. Despite the fact that \nevidence suggests that sarcopenic obesity leads to adverse health outcomes, \nresearch on its effects on aBMD, bone microarchitecture, falls and fractures in diverse \npopulations of older adults is currently controversial , owing primarily to a lack of \nconsensus on definitions of sarcopenia and obesity and limited data in non-Caucasian \npopulations. As such, this review has identified several research gaps that should be \ninvestigated in order to improve our understanding of the risk factors contributing to \nsarcopenic obesity and musculoskeletal consequences associated with this condition. \nHowever, this thesis will only investigate some of the many identified literature gaps \ndue to limited timeframe and capacity for initiating new trials as a result of the \nimplementation of restrictions on research during Covid-19 pandemic. Understanding \nthese relationships will aid in developing effective interventions to improve quality of \nlife for older adults with and at risk of sarcopenic obesity.\n\n 66 \nStatement of aims \nOverall hypothesis and aim: \nAim: This thesis examines risk factors for sarcopenic obesity and its effects on falls, \nfractures, and poor bone health in diverse populations of older adults. \nHypothesis: Disadvantaged s ocioeconomic status is associated with higher \nprevalence of sarcopenic obesity among older adults . Individuals with sarcopenic \nobesity have an increased risk of falls, and fractures and poor aBMD and bone \nmicroarchitecture, compared to individuals without sarcopenia and obesity. \n \nSpecific aims: \nChapter 2 \nAim: To investigate if socioeconomic factors such as education, occupation and area \nof residence are associated with the prevalence of obesity, sarcopenia , and \nsarcopenic obesity in community -dwelling Australian older adults , and whether \nphysical activity mediates these associations. \nHypothesis: Socioeconomic inequalities increase the risk of developing obesity, \nsarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity among older Australians, and insufficient physical \nactivity at least partly explains the associations. \n \nChapter 3 \nAim: To determine the incidence of, and compare risk factors for, incident fractures in \nolder adults with and without obesity defined by BMI and body fat percentage. \nHypothesis: Obesity defined by body fat percentage is associated with increased \nlikelihood of fractures, whereas obesity defined by BMI is protective for incident \n\n 67 \nfractures. Additionally, we hypothesise that sarcopenia components are associated \nwith increased risk of fractures in individuals with obesity. \n \nChapter 4 \nAim: To compare incidence of falls and fractures, and aBMD, in older adults with \nsarcopenic obesity to individuals with obesity, sarcopenia, and controls with neither \ncondition. \nHypothesis: Older adults with sarcopenic obesity have increased risk for falls and \nfractures, and poorer aBMD, compared to individuals with obesity and controls but \nhave higher aBMD with lower risk for falls and fractures compared with individuals with \nsarcopenia. \n \nChapter 5 \nAim: To investigate sex-specific differences in aBMD, BMAD and osteoporosis \nprevalence among Indian older adults with obesity, sarcopenia and sarcopenic \nobesity. \nHypothesis: Indian older adults with obesity, sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity have \nlower aBMD and BMAD , and higher prevalence of osteoporosis, compared with \ncounterparts with neither condition. \n \nChapter 6 \nAim: To determine the relationship between BMI, body fat percentage and \ncomponents of sarcopenia (muscle mass and muscle strength/power) with bone \nparameters assessed by HR-pQCT and DXA in older adults with obesity. \n\n 68 \nHypothesis: Higher BMI, but not higher body fat percentage, is associated with better \nbone microarchitecture . H igher muscle mass and muscle strength/power are \nassociated with better overall bone health, including bone microarchitecture, in older \nadults with obesity. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 69 \nChapter 2.0 – Associations between socioeconomic status and obesity, \nsarcopenia, and sarcopenic obesity in community-dwelling older adults: The \nTasmanian Older Adult Cohort Study \nChapter 2.1 – Introduction \n Globally, the population is ageing at a rapid pace as is the prevalence of obesity \n(1). It is projected that 31% of Australian older adults will have obesity by 2025 (2). \nThe confluence of ageing populations and obesity epidemics, may present many \neconomic challenges to the Au stralian healthcare system as a result of increased \nhospitalisation and dependency (2, 10). \nThere is limited evidence on risk factors that are associated with sarcopeni c \nobesity among older adults , particularly t he impact of socioeconomic determinants \nincluding education, occupation and area of residence . Limited data from primarily \ncross-sectional studies demonstrate conflicting associations between socioeconomic \ndeterminants and sarcopenic obesity (147, 160) . In addition, it is unclear whether \nsarcopenic obesity prevalence, like other conditions, has a socioeconomic gradient in \nolder adults. With shifts in socioeconomic profiles in Australia, it is imperative to \ninvestigate whether socioeconomic status is an important factor contributing to \nobesity, sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity in older adults (147, 156, 157, 311) . It is \nunclear whether physical activity mediates the effects of socioeconomic status on \nobesity, sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity in older adults. \nIf indeed socially disadvantaged individuals are more likely to develop \nsarcopenic obesity , and physical activity contributes to the associations between \nsocioeconomic status and sarcopenic obesity , it will have major implications for \nprimary prevention and management strategies in this population of older adults . \nTherefore, this chapter investigated if education, occupation and area of residenc are \n\n 70 \nassociated with obesity, sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity in community -dwelling \nAustralian older adults and whether physical activity levels mediated these \nassociations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 71 \nChapter 2.2 – Original research \nGandham A, Zengin A, Bonham MP, Brennan -Olsen SL, Aitken D, Winzenberg TM, \net al.

This study \ninvestigated if socioeconomic factors are associated with obesity, sarcopenia, or sarcopenic obesity (SO), in \ncommunity-dwelling older adults. \nMethods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of data from the Tasmanian Older Adult Cohort study. Obesity was \ndefined by body fat percentage (Men: /uni226525%; Women: /uni226535%) and sarcopenia was defined as the lowest 20% of \nsex-specific appendicular lean mass (ALM)/height (m\n2\n) and handgrip strength. Socioeconomic factors investi -\ngated were education (tertiary degree, secondary or no secondary school), occupation (high skilled white-collar, \nlow skilled white-collar, or blue-collar) and residential area (advantaged or disadvantaged area). Multinomial \nlogistic regression analyses yielding odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) were performed and adjusted for \npotential confounders. Mediation analysis was performed. \nResults: 1099 older adults (63.0 /uni00B1 7.5 years; 51.1% women) participated. Older adults with a tertiary degree \nwere significantly less likely to have obesity (0.68; 0.47, 0.98) and SO (0.48; 0.24, 0.94) compared with those \nwho had no secondary schooling. No associations were found for occupation. Similarly, older adults living in \nadvantaged areas were significantly less likely to have obesity (0.61; 0.39, 0.95). Steps per day mediated the \nassociation between residential area and body fat percentage by 51%. \nConclusion: Lower educational attainment, but not occupation, was associated with increased likelihood for both \nobesity and SO in community-dwelling older adults. Low physical activity levels in disadvantaged areas sub -\nstantially contributed to higher obesity prevalence in this population. Further research is necessary to confirm \nwhether similar associations exist in populations with greater levels of social disadvantage and to design effective \ncommunity-based interventions. \n1. Introduction \nAge-associated loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength, known as \nsarcopenia, is associated with functional decline ( Scott et al., 2016 ; \nDeschenes, 2004 ). Loss of lean mass along with increases in adiposity \nduring ageing increases the risk of sarcopenic obesity ( Abete et al., 2019 ; \nBatsis and Villareal, 2018 ; Scott et al., 2014 ). Sarcopenic obesity is \nassociated with an increased risk of adverse health outcomes, morbidity \nand frailty among older adults ( Abete et al., 2019 ; Batsis and Villareal, \n2018 ; Scott et al., 2014 ). There is no consensus definition of sarcopenic \n* Corresponding author at: Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Sciences at Monash Health, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria 3168, Australia. \nE-mail address: anoohya.gandham@monash.edu (A.

Therefore, it is difficult \nfor clinicians to identify older adults who may require interventions to \nprevent or treat sarcopenic obesity ( Prokopidis et al., 2020 ). \nSocioeconomic determinants including educational attainment, \noccupation types, income and area of residence are important predictors \nof musculoskeletal health outcomes particularly in lower income \ncountries ( Moreira et al., 2016 ; Alexandre Tda et al., 2014 ; Brennan- \nOlsen et al., 2019 ). The negative health implications of disadvantaged \nsocioeconomic status (SES) on musculoskeletal health may be sustained \nthroughout life ( Jeng et al., 2018 ). Limited cross-sectional and longi -\ntudinal studies have reported that income, occupation and educational \nattainment are associated with obesity, sarcopenia and sarcopenic \nobesity in several countries ( Alexandre Tda et al., 2014 ; Moreno-Franco \net al., 2018 ; Kim et al., 2018 ). However, to date, no studies have \nexplored the relationship of SES factors with both sarcopenia and \nobesity among Australian older adults. Therefore, to address this \nknowledge gap, we aimed to determine associations between a range of \nSES factors and sarcopenic obesity in a population of community- \ndwelling Australian older adults, and whether physical activity levels \nmediate these associations. \n2. Methods \n2.1. Study design and participants \nBaseline data from the Tasmanian Older Adult Cohort (TasOAC) \nstudy, a prospective, population-based observational study which was \nconducted from 2002 to 2004 including 1099 older adults (aged /uni003E50 \nyears) residing in Tasmania, Australia, were utilised for this analysis. \nThis study was primarily established to identify factors associated with \nthe development and progression of osteoarthritis. Participants were \nrecruited from a computer-based random number system from the \nelectoral rolls in southern Tasmania. Participants were excluded due to \ncontraindication for magnetic resonance imaging and if they were \ninstitutionalised. This study was approved by the Southern Tasmanian \nHeath and Medical Human Research Ethics Committee (H0006488), and \nall study participants provided written informed consent. \n2.2. Sarcopenia and obesity \nHeight (m) and weight (kg) were measured to the nearest 0.1 kg and \n0.1 cm; headgear, accessories, heavy items of clothing including shoes \nand socks removed. Height was measured using a stadiometer (Leicester \nheight measure) and weight was measured using an electronic scale \n(Seca Delta Model 707, Bradford, Massachusetts, USA). Body mass index \n(BMI) (kg/m\n2\n) was subsequently calculated using weight (kg) divided by \nheight squared (m\n2\n). Waist and hip circumference were measured to the \nnearest 0.1 cm using a measuring tape which was then utilised to \ncalculate the waist/hip ratio. \nWhole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans were \nperformed to measure appendicular lean mass (ALM) and total body fat \npercentage using the Hologic DXA scanner (Hologic Corp., Waltham, \nMassachusetts, USA). \nHand grip strength was measured using a pneumatic bulb dyna -\nmometer (North Coast ™ bulb dynamometer; adult 0-30psi, model no. \n70, 154). Participants were required to use their maximum force by \nholding the dynamometer for 3 s in a seated position with their hip and \nelbow at a 90\n/uni25E6\nangle. Participants performed this assessment twice in \neach of their hands, with a 30 s rest between the two trials, and an \naverage of the two trials was used for analyses. \nSarcopenia was defined as the lowest 20% of the sex specific ALM/ \nheight (m)\n2 \n( /uni003C8.78 kg/m\n2 \nfor men /uni003C6.96 kg/m\n2 \nfor women) and hand \ngrip strength ( /uni003C11.88 psi for men and /uni003C8.63 psi for women). This is \nconsistent with the methodologies used to obtain cut-points recom -\nmended in the original European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older \nPeople definition (EWGSOP1) ( Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2010 ). With the \nrecommended cut-points from the revised European Working Group on \nSarcopenia in Older People revised definition (EWGSOP2) we only had 3 \nparticipants with low muscle mass and the dynamometer used in our \nstudy was pneumatic and therefore the EWGSOP2 cut-points for hand \ngrip strength could not be applied ( Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2019 ). We also \nchose not to use the 2 standard deviations below the sex-specific mean \ndefinition for sarcopenia as only 10 participants had low hand grip \nstrength and no participants had low ALM. \nObesity was defined based on DXA-derived body fat percentage cut \npoints of /uni2265 25% for men and /uni2265 35% for women as previously recom -\nmended ( Romero-Corral et al., 2008 ; Okorodudu et al., 2010 ). Body fat \npercentaage was utilised for the main analyses as it is a direct and ac -\ncurate measure of adiposity which can avoid the misclassification of \nobesity status which may occur using the more common approach of \nBMI ( Gandham et al., 2020 ). Indeed, when obesity was defined by BMI \n/uni2265 30 kg/m\n2 \nin the present study, 333 (31%) participants had obesity and \nonly 5 (0.5%) had sarcopenic obesity. Sarcopenic obesity was defined \nbased on the classifications for sarcopenia and obesity mentioned above. \nFor the purpose of this study participants were categorised into four \ngroups as having one of the following: non-sarcopenic non-obesity \n(NSNO), obesity alone, sarcopenia alone or sarcopenic obesity. \n2.3. Education, occupation and area of residence \nEducation, occupation and area of residence were all self-reported \nusing questionnaires. Highest level of education was categorised into \nthree subgroups: completed tertiary education, completed secondary/ \nhigh school or not completed secondary/high school. Similarly, the \nlongest-held occupations were categorised into high skilled (HS) white- \ncollar, low skilled (LS) white-collar, blue-collar or armed forces based on \nthe International Standard Classification of Occupation (ISCO) coding \nsystem ( ILO, 1990 ; ILO, 2004 ; EuroFound, 2010 ). Area-level disadvan -\ntage was matched with baseline residential address of each of the par -\nticipants in the study corresponding to the Australian Bureau of \nStatistics (ABS) Census Collection District for 2001. ABS software was \nthen utilised to evaluate the Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) \nscore ( Brennan et al., 2013 ; ABS, 2001 ). For the purpose of this study, \nwe employed the Index of Relative Socioeconomic Advantage and \nDisadvantage (IRSAD) in order to rank the relative advantage/disad -\nvantage of the area in which people resided. Quartile cut points for \nIRSAD values were based on the study region of Southern Tasmania, \nAustralia, as previously employed ( Brennan et al., 2013 ; ABS, 2001 ). \n2.4. Covariates \nAge, smoking status, protein intake and alcohol consumption were \nself-reported using questionnaires. Participants also reported if they had \nbeen diagnosed with any comorbidities (from a list including diabetes, \nheart attack, hypertension, thrombosis, asthma, bronchitis/emphysema, \nosteoporosis, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis \nand other major illnesses), from which a composite comorbidity score \nwas calculated based on the number of positive responses. \nPhysical activity was measured using pedometers (Omron HJ-003 \nand HJ-102, Omron Healthcare, Kyoto, Japan) worn by participants \non their hip for 7 consecutive days. Steps per day was calculated by \ntaking an average number of steps across the days for participants who \nhad data recorded for more than 4 days. \n2.5. Statistical analysis \nCharacteristics of participants were reported as mean /uni00B1 standard \ndeviation for continuous variables, or as percentages for categorical \nvariables, according to sarcopenia and obesity groups. Chi-squared test \nwas performed to evaluate the differences in proportion of older adults \nin each of the sarcopenia and obesity groups for each category of \neducational attainment, occupation types and IRSAD quartiles. \nA. Gandham et al. \n\nExperimental Gerontology 156 (2021) 111627\n3\nMultinomial logistic regression was performed to evaluate the as -\nsociations between educational attainment, occupation types and \nadvantaged/disadvantaged area of residence based on IRSAD quartiles \nwith each of the sarcopenia and obesity groups. Due to the low number \nof older adults (8 participants) with occupations in armed forces, this \ngroup was excluded from this particular analysis. Older adults with \nsarcopenic obesity, obesity alone and sarcopenia alone were compared \nwith the NSNO group and were also compared with counterparts with \nobesity alone to evaluate whether SES factors increase the likelihood of \nco-morbid sarcopenia in older adults with obesity. For the purpose of \nthis analysis, a binary variable was created based on the four IRSAD \nquartiles ranging from disadvantaged (Quartiles 1 and 2) to advantaged \n(Quartiles 3 and 4) area levels. Models were adjusted for the following \nconfounders: age, sex, total number of comorbidities, smoking status, \nprotein intake, alcohol consumption and SES factors (i.e. models \ninvestigating educational attainment were adjusted for occupation types \nand those investigating occupation types were adjusted for educational \nattainment). Given IRSAD accounts for education and occupation, no \nfurther adjustments were performed for the area of residence variable. \nLinear regression analysis was performed to further evaluate the asso -\nciations between components of sarcopenia and obesity with educa -\ntional attainment, occupation types and area of residence \n(Supplementary Table 1). Models were adjusted for the same con -\nfounders listed above for the multinomial regression analysis. \nModels in the multinomial logistic regression and linear regression \nanalyses were not adjusted for steps per day given we hypothesise that \nthis is a potential mediator, rather than confounder, in the association \nbetween SES and sarcopenia obesity. Mediation analysis was performed \nto evaluate whether steps per day mediated associations between SES \nfactors and components of sarcopenic obesity (ALM, hand grip strength \nand body fat percentage). Path X corresponds to the effect of area of \nresidence on steps per day. Path Y corresponds to the effect of steps per \nday on handgrip strength (a), ALM (b) and body fat percentage (c). The \ntotal effect captured by the direct (Z) and indirect (Z') effects with the \nmediator steps per day. The percentage mediation was used to calculate \nthe effect size using the formula: P\nM \n/uni003D XY/(XY /uni002B Z ’ ) ( MacKinnon et al., \n2002 ). \nFor all analyses a p /uni003C 0.05 or 95% confidence intervals not including \nthe null point was considered statistically significant. \n3. Results \nOne thousand, one hundred participants were enrolled in the \nTasOAC study and baseline data was obtained for 1099 participants \n(mean age of 63.0 /uni00B1 7.5 years). Three participants had missing SES data, \ntwo participants had missing hand grip strength data and seven partic -\nipants in total had missing DXA data and were therefore excluded from \nthe main analysis. Table 1 describes characteristics according to sarco -\npenia and obesity status. Participants with sarcopenic obesity were \nolder, less physically active and had higher BMI and waist circumference \ncompared with the NSNO group. They also had a lower waist circum -\nference and BMI compared to those with obesity. A higher proportion of \nwomen were in the obesity and sarcopenic obesity groups compared to \nsarcopenia alone and NSNO. Participants with sarcopenia had lower \nBMI and waist circumference compared with both the NSNO and obesity \ngroups. \nThe proportion of older adults in sarcopenia and obesity groups in \neach category of educational attainment, occupation types and IRSAD \nquartiles are given in Fig. 1 . A higher proportion of older adults with \nsarcopenic obesity or obesity alone did not complete secondary \nschooling compared to the NSNO group ( p /uni003C 0.05). Similarly, a higher \nproportion of older adults with sarcopenic obesity had LS white-collar \noccupations compared with the NSNO group ( p /uni003C 0.05). In addition, a \nhigher proportion of older adults with sarcopenic obesity or obesity also \nresided in the most disadvantaged areas (Quartile 1) compared with the \nNSNO group ( p /uni003C 0.05). \nThe likelihood of having obesity, sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity \nwas determined according to educational attainment, occupation types \nand area level advantage/disadvantage ( Table 2 ). In unadjusted ana -\nlyses (Model 1), older adults who completed tertiary education were \n42% less likely to have sarcopenic obesity compared to those who did \nnot complete secondary schooling. These results persisted after adjust -\ning for confounders including age, sex, total number of comorbidities, \nsmoking status, protein intake and alcohol consumption (Model 2) and \neven after further adjustment for occupation types in (Model 3) ( P /uni003C\n0.05). Older adults who completed tertiary education were 55 – 59% less \nlikely to have obesity and 42% less likely to have sarcopenic obesity \ncompared with those who completed secondary schooling in all three \nmodels. \nOlder adults with HS white-collar occupations were 39 – 44% less \nlikely to have sarcopenic obesity compared to those with LS white-collar \noccupations (Model 1 and 2). When obesity was set as the reference \ngroup, older adults with HS white-collar occupations were 49% less \nlikely to have sarcopenic obesity compared to those with LS white-collar \noccupations after adjusting for confounders (Model 2). Participants \nresiding in advantaged areas were 57 – 61% less likely to have obesity in \nboth models (Model 1 and 2) and 43% less likely to have sarcopenic \nobesity compared to those residing in disadvantaged areas in the un -\nadjusted model only (Model 1). \nSimilarly, linear regression analysis demonstrated that older adults \nresiding in advantaged areas had significantly lower body fat percentage \n(Model 1 and 2; Supplementary Table 1). Older adults residing in \nadvantaged areas also had higher ALM/body fat percentage and hand \ngrip strength/body fat percentage compared to those residing in disad -\nvantaged areas (Model 1 and 2; Supplementary Table 1). \nMediation analysis ( Fig. 2 ) explored the relationships between so -\ncioeconomic factors and components of sarcopenic obesity with steps \nper day as the mediator. The percentage mediation (P\nM\n) effect of 51% \nhas suggested that steps per day was a strong mediator of the association \nbetween area of residence and body fat percentage.

Gandham et al. \n\nExperimental Gerontology 156 (2021) 111627\n4\nindirect effects have indicated that older adults residing in advantaged \nareas were more likely to have lower body fat percentage as a result of \nhigher physical activity (both p /uni003C 0.05) However, steps per day did not \nmediate the effect of area of residence on handgrip strength or ALM. \nSteps per day did not significantly mediate the relationships of educa -\ntional attainment and occupation levels with any of the components of \nsarcopenic obesity (data not shown; all p /uni003E 0.05). \n4. Discussion \nThe primary finding of this cross-sectional study was that lower \neducational attainment and disadvantaged area of residence were \nassociated with obesity and lower educational attainment was associ -\nated with sarcopenic obesity in community-dwelling older adults. \nResiding in disadvantaged areas was also associated with lower ALM \nand hand grip strength after adjustment for body fat percentage. \nAlthough an association was not observed between area of residence and \nsarcopenic obesity, steps per day mediated the association with obesity \nsuggesting that public health interventions for prevention of obesity and \nsarcopenic obesity in older adults should include physical activity spe -\ncifically designed for lower SES groups. \nRecent evidence indicates that educational disadvantages may have \nsignificant associations with sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity ( Jeng \net al., 2018 ; Tyrovolas et al., 2016 ; Hwang et al., 2012 ). A study of \n10,325 adults from Louisiana, USA showed that lower educational level \nwas associated with increased prevalence of sarcopenia and sarcopenic \nobesity among both men and women ( Jeng et al., 2018 ). Another study \nof 2221 Korean older adults aged 60 years and older also demonstrated \nthat completing middle-school education or lower was associated with \nan increased likelihood of sarcopenic obesity among men ( Hwang et al., \n2012 ). Likewise, in the current study, older adults with lower educa -\ntional attainment were more likely to have sarcopenic obesity and \nobesity compared to those with a higher level of education, but not \nsarcopenia. The lack of associations with sarcopenia may be due to low \npower given the small number of participants (particularly women) \nclassified as having sarcopenia in this study. Higher education has been \nfound to be protective against obesity as it increases cognitive abilities \naiding in health-related knowledge promoting healthier lifestyles \n( Lawrence, 2017 ). Lower education may also lead to unhealthier life -\nstyles as a result of individual's having lower purchasing power due to \ntheir decreased capacity for income ( Santos et al., 2015 ; Aitsi-Selmi \net al., 2013 ). \nOccupation type can also impact an individual's overall health ( Aitsi- \nSelmi et al., 2013 ). Income and occupation type are important social \ndeterminants that may contribute towards increased prevalence of \nobesity, sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity ( Kim et al., 2018 ; Dorosty \net al., 2016 ). In a study of 644 older adults aged 60 years and over, those \nwith low income had a higher risk of sarcopenia compared to those with \nmiddle or high income but in the current study the effects of income \ncould not be directly evaluated ( Dorosty et al., 2016 ). However, in \nanother study including 679 men aged /uni2265 65 years sarcopenia and sar -\ncopenic obesity were influenced by lifetime occupation, with individuals \nwith white-collar occupations most likely to have sarcopenic obesity and \nobesity ( Kim et al., 2018 ). This is consistent with our results that in -\ndividuals with white-collar occupations, particularly LS white-collar \noccupations, were most likely to have increased likelihood of sarco -\npenic obesity compared with HS white-collar occupations. However, \nthis association was attenuated after adjusting for educational attain -\nment, suggesting that this association is being driven by education. It \nwas interesting that there were no differences between LS white-collar \nand blue-collar occupations which may suggest a protective effect of \nblue-collar work due to higher activity levels ( Kim et al., 2018 ). \nThere is recent evidence that area of residence could also affect an \nindividual's overall health ( Ghosh et al., 2016 ). In line with the current \nstudy findings, a study of 36,674 adults demonstrated a higher risk for \nobesity among both men and women residing in areas of high socio -\neconomic disadvantage after adjusting for age ( Ghosh et al., 2016 ). A \npossible explanation for this could be that older adults residing in \nadvantaged areas have better access to health care services and social \nsupport compared to those living in disadvantaged areas ( Lindgren \net al., 2016 ; Shahar et al., 2019 ). In support, in a study of 887 com -\nmunity dwelling older adults aged 60 years and over, those living in \nrural areas were more vulnerable to sarcopenia ( Chrisman et al., 2015 ). \nIn the current study older adults residing in disadvantaged areas \ndemonstrated a higher risk of sarcopenic obesity and obesity. A possible \nexplanation could be that older adults residing in disadvantaged areas \nhave lower health literacy, multimorbidity, poorer dietary habits and \nlower physical fitness levels as a result of their low income and/or ed -\nucation ( Chrisman et al., 2015 ). The effects on sarcopenia however \ncould not be evaluated due to the low number of older adults with \nsarcopenia. Although, it was notable that in the analysis using contin -\nuous variables, there were no associations of ALM and hand grip \nstrength with area of residence except when these variables were \nadjusted for body fat percentage. \nOverall, the effects of socioeconomic status in this study were more \nevident for obesity than sarcopenic obesity. Mediation analysis \nFig. 1. Proportion of older adults in each of the sarcopenia and/or obesity group by educational attainment, occupation types and IRSAD quartiles. Abbreviations: \nLS, low-skilled; HS, high-skilled; IRSAD, Index of Relative Socioeconomic Advantage and Disadvantage; NSNO, non-sarcopenic non-obesity; O, obesity; S, sarcopenia; \nSO, sarcopenic obesity. Significance is denoted by a for significant difference between NSNO and obesity and b for significant difference between NSNO and sar -\ncopenic obesity. \nA. Gandham et al. \n\nExperimental Gerontology 156 (2021) 111627\n5\nindicated that this may be explained by a relationship of socioeconomic \nstatus with physical activity among those with obesity. Older adults \nresiding in disadvantaged areas were less likely to be physically active as \nopposed to older adults residing in advantaged areas ( Lindgren et al., \n2016 ). Individuals residing in disadvantaged areas are prone to inactive \nlifestyles and may therefore be more likely to experience adverse health \noutcomes ( Shahar et al., 2019 ; Chrisman et al., 2015 ). A study of 3567 \nparticipants aged 30 – 65 years from China reported that both physical \nactivity type and intensity were different based on socioeconomic status \nwith those with highest socioeconomic status more likely to participate \nin exercise ( Chen et al., 2015 ). Similarly, a recent systematic review has \ndemonstrated that physical activity domains differed based on the so -\ncioeconomic status, with individuals of lower socioeconomic status less \nlikely to participate in vigorous activities compared to those with higher \nsocioeconomic status ( Craike et al., 2018 ). Interventions that address \nsocioeconomic barriers to participation in physical activity and exercise \nare required to reduce the overall disease burden which affects this \npopulation ( Chen et al., 2015 ; Craike et al., 2018 ). A recent review has \nsuggested that group-based interventions with those that focus on \nphysical activity rather than obesity prevention may be effective for \nolder adults with low socioeconomic status ( Craike et al., 2018 ). Higher \nlevels of physical activity alone may however not be as effective in \nreducing the risk of sarcopenia as opposed to engaging in higher in -\ntensities of physical activity along with the consumption of nutrient rich \ndiets among those living in disadvantaged areas ( Beenackers et al., \n2012 ; Gao et al., 2015 ; Granic et al., 2019 ; Lee et al., 2016 ; Marcos- \nPardo et al., 2020 ). Further longitudinal studies are therefore required to \nunderstand the most effective interventions for preventing sarcopenic \nobesity among older adults with diverse socioeconomic status. \nThere are several limitations to this study. Firstly, this was a cross- \nsectional analysis. All study participants resided in Tasmania, \nAustralia and were 98% Caucasian. As such, the results may not be \ngeneralised to other populations, particularly those with substantially \ndifferent SES profiles. It should also be noted that the data were \ncollected between 2002 and 2004 and it is likely that there are shifts in \nSES profile over time, and therefore may not be representative of the \nassociations in this population at the present time. Also, residual con -\nfounding and other confounders which were not assessed in this study \ncould affect the associations between SES and sarcopenia and obesity \ngroups. Other lifestyle factors such as nutrition behaviours could also \nmediate the relationships between SES and obesity. The associations \nbased on gender could also not be evaluated in this study due to insuf -\nficient power particularly for the sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity \ngroups. Also, physical activity was measured using pedometers in the \nTable 2 \nMultinomial logistic regression showing difference between educational \nattainment, occupation types and area of residence among sarcopenia and/or \nobesity groups. \nObesity vs \nNSNO \nSarcopenia vs \nNSNO \nSarcopenic \nobesity vs NSNO \nSarcopenic \nobesity vs Obesity \nCompleted vs not completed secondary/high school \nModel \n1 \n1.17 (0.73, \n1.87) \n1.36 (0.22, \n8.53) \n0.98 (0.46, 2.12) 0.84 (0.43, 1.63) \nModel \n2 \n1.25 (0.77, \n2.01) \n1.58 (0.25, \n10.11) \n1.16 (0.53, 2.57) 0.91 (0.46, 1.79) \nModel \n3 \n1.22 (0.75, \n1.99) \n1.46 (0.23, \n9.34) \n1.13 (0.51, 2.51) 0.90 (0.46, 1.77) \nTertiary vs not completed secondary/high school \nModel \n1 \n0.65 (0.46, \n0.91) \n0.96 (0.22, \n4.13) \n0.42 (0.22, \n0.79) \n0.64 (0.36, 1.15) \nModel \n2 \n0.74 (0.52, \n1.06) \n0.95 (0.21, \n4.24) \n0.49 (0.25, \n0.95) \n0.65 (0.36, 1.19) \nModel \n3 \n0.68 (0.47, \n0.98) \n1.02 (0.22, \n4.61) \n0.48 (0.24, \n0.94) \n0.69 (0.37, 1.27) \nTertiary vs completed secondary/high school \nModel \n1 \n0.55 (0.36, \n0.86) \n0.71 (0.13, \n3.81) \n0.42 (0.19, \n0.93) \n0.76 (0.38, 1.54) \nModel \n2 \n0.59 (0.38, \n0.93) \n0.60 (0.11, \n3.30) \n0.42 (0.19, \n0.94) \n0.72 (0.35, 1.47) \nModel \n3 \n0.56 (0.35, \n0.89) \n0.70 (0.12, \n3.95) \n0.42 (0.18, \n0.97) \n0.76 (0.37, 1.59) \nHS white-collar vs LS white-collar \nModel \n1 \n0.68 (0.48, \n0.98) \n0.66 (0.16, \n2.72) \n0.39 (0.20, \n0.75) \n0.57 (0.32, 1.03) \nModel \n2 \n0.90 (0.60, \n1.34) \n0.43 (0.09, \n1.97) \n0.44 (0.21, \n0.91) \n0.49 (0.26, 0.94) \nModel \n3 \n1.16 (0.73, \n1.82) \n0.45 (0.08, \n2.51) \n0.64 (0.27, 1.52) 0.56 (0.26, 1.21) \nBlue-collar vs LS white-collar \nModel \n1 \n0.82 (0.54, \n1.25) \n0.65 (0.11, \n3.70) \n0.53 (0.25, 1.12) 0.65 (0.33, 1.26) \nModel \n2 \n1.23 (0.76, \n1.99) \n0.35 (0.05, \n2.21) \n0.65 (0.27, 1.54) 0.53 (0.25, 1.14) \nModel \n3 \n1.37 (0.83, \n2.23) \n0.34 (0.05, \n2.13) \n0.80 (0.34, 1.95) 0.59 (0.27, 1.30) \nBlue-collar vs HS white-collar \nModel \n1 \n1.20 (0.81, \n1.77) \n0.99 (0.18, \n5.60) \n1.35 (0.62, 2.98) 1.13 (0.55, 2.35) \nModel \n2 \n1.37 (0.90, \n2.07) \n0.81 (0.14, \n4.71) \n1.47 (0.65, 3.36) 1.08 (0.51, 2.29) \nModel \n3 \n1.18 (0.76, \n1.85) \n0.75 (0.12, \n4.86) \n1.26 (0.52, 3.05) 1.07 (0.48, 2.39) \nAdvantaged vs disadvantaged area of residence \nModel \n1 \n0.57 (0.37, \n0.87) \n– 0.43 (0.22, \n0.85) \n0.75 (0.42, 1.35) \nModel \n2 \n0.61 (0.39, \n0.95) \n– 0.54 (0.26, 1.10) 0.88 (0.48, 1.62) \nData presented as odds ratios (95% confidence intervals).

Gandham et al. \n\nExperimental Gerontology 156 (2021) 111627\n6\ncurrent study. The use of other objective measures of physical activity \nsuch as accelerometers could provide more insights into how intensity, \nduration and frequency of physical activity may mediate the relation -\nships between area of residence and obesity. The study participants were \nalso generally healthy as evidenced by the low prevalence of sarcopenia \n(1%) and sarcopenic obesity (6%) and due to the low numbers, the ef -\nfects of area level advantage and disadvantage on sarcopenia alone are \nunclear. Finally, sarcopenia was defined using the lowest 20% of the sex- \nspecific appendicular lean mass (ALM)/height(m\n2) \nand handgrip \nstrength rather than the ALM cut points recommended in EWGSOP2 \ndefinition and hence may not be comparable with other studies using \ndifferent definitions to define sarcopenia. \nIn conclusion, lower socioeconomic status, specifically lower \neducational attainment and disadvantaged area of residence, were \nassociated with higher likelihood of obesity and lower educational \nattainment was associated with higher likelihood for sarcopenic obesity \nin community-dwelling older adults. The association of area of residence \nwith obesity, but not sarcopenic obesity, appears to be mediated by \nphysical activity levels. Further research is required in order to deter -\nmine if similar associations exist in diverse populations and to under -\nstand the most effective interventions for preventing sarcopenic obesity \namong older adults with diverse socioeconomic status. \nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at https://doi. \norg/10.1016/j.exger.2021.111627 . \nFunding \nThis work was supported by the National Health and Medical \nResearch Council of Australia, Arthritis Foundation of Australia, Tas -\nmanian Community Fund, and University of Tasmania Institutional \nResearch Grants Scheme. \nEthics approval \nThe study was approved by the Southern Tasmanian Health and \nMedical Human Research Ethics Committee. \nConsent to participate \nAll participants included in the study provided written informed \nconsent. \nConsent for publication \nConsent obtained for publication. \nCRediT authorship contribution statement \nAnoohya Gandham: Writing – original draft, Writing – review & \nediting, Formal analysis.

The remaining thesis chapters explore associations \nof sarcopenic obesity, and its components, with falls, fractures and other aspects of \nbone and muscle health. If sarcopenic obesity is demonstrated to be an important \ncontributor to these outcomes, interventions may be developed to target \nimprovements in socioeconomic factors and physical activity levels in order to reduce \nincidence of sarcopenic obesity and associated falls and fractures in older populations. \nSeveral studies have investigated relationships between BMI and bone health (4, 312-\n314). These studies have demonstrated that higher BMI is associated with higher \naBMD in older adults, and that individuals with obesity defined by BMI have lower \nfracture risk compared with those with normal BMI (260, 312, 314). Risk of fractures \nat certain skeletal sites including the lower limbs however is higher among those with \nhigh BMI (257, 263). This increased site-specific fracture risk may be explained by \nseveral factors including increased falls risk. The dominant index used worldwide to \ndefine obesity is BMI, which is positively associated with aBMD but does not account \nfor relative adiposity (8, 9) . Unlike BMI, DXA -determined body fat percent age is \nassociated with poorer aBMD and potentially, increased risk of fractures (8, 9, 97, \n315). No studies have previously compared the associations between obesity and \nbone health defined by both BMI and body fat percentage in older adults. Therefore, \nthis chapter compared and determined risk factors associated with incident fractures \namong older adults with obesity defined by both BMI and body fat percentage. \n\n 80 \nChapter 3.2 – Original Research \nGandham A, Zengin A, Bonham MP, Winzenberg T, Balogun S, Wu F, et al.

Obesity status at baseline was deﬁned by BMI ( ≥30 kg/m2) obtained by anthropometry \nand body fat percentage (≥30% for men and ≥40% for women) assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry \n(DXA). Total hip and lumbar spine areal bone mineral density (aBMD) were assessed by DXA up to ﬁve years. \nIncident fractures were self-reported up to 10 years. \nResults: Prevalence of obesity was 28% according to BMI and 43% according to body fat percentage. Obese older \nadults by BMI, but not body fat percentage, had signiﬁcantly higher aBMD at the total hip and spine compared \nwith non-obese (both p-value < 0.05). Obese older adults by body fat percentage had signiﬁcantly higher \nlikelihood of all incident fractures (OR: 1.71; CI:1.08, 2.71) and non-vertebral fractures (OR: 1.88; CI:1.16, 3.04) \ncompared with non-obese after adjusting for confounders. Conversely, obese older adults by BMI had a sig -\nniﬁcantly lower likelihood (OR: 0.54; CI:0.31, 0.94) of non-vertebral fractures although this was no longer \nsigniﬁcant after adjustment for total hip aBMD (all p-value > 0.05). Mediation analysis conﬁrmed that aBMD \nmeditated the e ﬀects of BMI, but not body fat percentage, on all incident fractures. Higher baseline falls risk \nscore was the only consistent predictor of increased likelihood of incident fracture in obese individuals only, \naccording to both BMI and body fat percentage (both p-value < 0.05). \nConclusions: Obesity deﬁned by body fat percentage is associated with increased likelihood of incident fractures \nin community-dwelling older adults, whereas those who are obese according to BMI have reduced likelihood of \nincident fracture which appears to be explained by higher aBMD. Falls risk assessment may improve identiﬁ -\ncation of obese older adults at increased risk of incident fractures. \n1. Introduction \nThere has been a substantial increase in obesity and aging of the \npopulation in recent years [ 1,2]. Although older adults with obesity \n(deﬁned by body mass index; BMI) have high areal bone mineral den -\nsity (aBMD) and generally demonstrate reduced risk of fracture com -\npared with non-obese counterparts, they are more susceptible to certain \ntypes of fractures [3]. Hence, low-trauma fractures are common among \nobese older adults and this could be explained by risk factors such as \nincreased falls risk, higher numbers of comorbidities, poorer physical \nactivity and nutrition [4–6]. \nAlthough obesity status is primarily deﬁned by BMI this may not be \nrepresentative of an individuals' adiposity [ 7,8]. Dual-energy X-ray \nabsorptiometry (DXA) is a low-cost and widely available technique for \naccurately measuring body fat, and aBMD, so may be useful in identi -\nfying the eﬀects of adiposity on fracture risk in older adults [ 7,8].

[ 9] \nNo studies have determined the risk factors and underlying me -\nchanisms contributing to increased incident fractures among older men \nand women with obesity deﬁned by body fat percentage and BMI. It is \nimportant to identify predictors of fracture in obese individuals given a \nlarge proportion of fractures occur in this population [2], and these are \nassociated with increased loss of independence, ﬁnancial burden, mor -\ntality and morbidity rates [1,10]. The aim of this study was to compare \nincident fracture risk and associated risk factors among obese and non- \nobese older adults, deﬁned by both BMI and body fat percentage. \n2. Methods \n2.1. Study design and participants \nThe Tasmanian Older Adult Cohort (TASOAC) study is a pro -\nspective, population-based observational study of older adults aged \nbetween 50 and 79 years. Participants were randomly selected from a \ncomputer-based random number system from the electoral roll in \nsouthern Tasmania. 1100 participants were enrolled in the study; ap -\nproximately 51.1% were women. Participants were required to attend \nMenzies Research Institute in Hobart, Tasmania, for the collection of \ndata. 1099 participants had baseline data collected, 875 at 2.7 years \nfollow-up, 769 at 5 years follow-up and 566 participants for the ﬁnal \n10 years follow-up. The study was approved by the Southern Tasmanian \nHealth and Medical Human Research Ethics Committee and all parti -\ncipants provided written informed consent. \n2.2. Sociodemographic and general health \nAt baseline, age, demographics, smoking status, alcohol consump -\ntion, energy intake and disease history were self-reported using ques -\ntionnaires. Participants also reported whether they had been diagnosed \nwith any comorbidities (from a list including diabetes, heart attack, \nhypertension, thrombosis, asthma, bronchitis/emphysema, osteo -\nporosis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis and \nother major illness) and a composite comorbidity score was calculated \nbased on the sum of positive responses. \n2.3. Medications \nAt the day of the clinic visit, participants were required to bring all \nprescription or over-the-counter medications that they were taking. All \ndetails regarding medication use and prescription patterns were col -\nlected. Any bone-strengthening or osteoporosis treatment related \nmedications that were likely to inﬂuence aBMD including bispho -\nsphonates, corticosteroids, calcium, vitamin D, progesterone and es -\ntrogen were considered as bone active medications. \n2.4. Incident fractures \nFractures were self-reported at approximately 2.7, 5 and 10 years \nfrom baseline. Participants responded to the following question: “List \nany fracture you may have had since your previous interview for this \nstudy. Please list these by the location of the fractures (e.g. left thumb, \nright wrist)” [11]. Incident fractures were then classiﬁed as all fractures \nand non-vertebral fractures (all incident fractures except for the ver -\ntebrae). \n2.5. Anthropometrics and bone parameters \nHeight (m) and weight (kg) were measured at baseline with head -\ngear, heavy items of clothing including shoes and socks removed. \nHeight was measured using a stadiometer (Leicester height measure) \nand weight was measured using an electronic scale (Seca Delta Model \n707, Bradford, Massachusetts, USA). Body mass index (BMI) was cal -\nculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m 2). Waist and hip cir -\ncumference were measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a measuring \ntape. DXA scans were performed to measure appendicular lean mass \n(ALM), total body fat percentage, aBMD at the total hip and spine using \nHologic DXA (Hologic Corp., Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). \nObesity was deﬁned by both BMI and body fat percentage. Obesity \nstatus by BMI was deﬁned using World Health Organisation (WHO) \nclassiﬁcations: underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (BMI \n18.5–24.9 kg/m 2), overweight (BMI 25.0–29.9 kg/m 2) and obese \n(BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2) [12]. Obesity was also deﬁned based on DXA-de -\ntermined body fat percentage; we used cut-oﬀ points of ≥30% for men \nand women ≥40%, as previously recommended [ 13,14]. For compar-\nison, we additionally explored cut-o ﬀ points of ≥25% (men) \nand ≥35% (women) as these are commonly used to deﬁne obesity in \nthe literature [15]. \n2.6. Falls risk score \nFalls risk scores were estimated from the physical proﬁle assessment \n(PPA) at baseline [16]. Standardised z-scores were calculated based on \nthe performance in ﬁve physiological domains including vision (edge \ncontrast sensitivity), sensation (proprioception), strength (knee exten -\nsion), reaction time and balance (body sway) [16]. A falls risk score of 0 \nor less indicates low risk, 0 to 1 indicates a mild risk, 1 to 2 indicates a \nmoderate risk and a score of 2 or above indicates a high risk of falls. \n2.7. Physical function assessments \nLeg strength was measured at baseline in both legs using a dy -\nnamometer and recorded to the nearest kilogram (TTM Muscular Meter, \nTokyo, Japan). Participants were required to stand on the back of the \nleg dynamometer with ﬂat feet while looking straight ahead, with their \nhead and back leaning against the wall. Participants ﬂexed their knees \nuntil 115° angle was obtained and then were instructed to hold a bar \nthat was connected to the dynamometer ﬂat on the thighs using both \nhands. While keeping a ﬁrm grip on the bar and looking straight ahead, \nthey had to lift the bar upwards with maximum force using their legs \nuntil a maximal contraction was achieved. Participants performed this \nassessment twice, where the higher score was recorded [ 17]. \nKnee extension (quadriceps) muscle strength was measured in the \ndominant leg to the nearest kilogram. Participants were required to be \nseated in a chair with their hip and knees at a 90 ° angle. A strap was \npositioned 10 cm above the lateral malleolus which was connected to \nthe back of the chair and the participants were required to push against \nthe strap with their maximum power. \nHand grip strength was performed using a pneumatic bulb dynam -\nometer (North Coast™ bulb dynamometer; adult 0–30 psi, model no. 70, \n154) and was measured to the nearest kilogram. Participants were re -\nquired to hold the dynamometer with their elbow at a 90 ° angle in a \nseated position measured in both hands. Participants were required to \nuse their maximum force possible for three seconds and were required \nto complete this assessment twice in each of the hands with a 30 s rest \nbetween the trials. Mean scores of the two trials were used for the \nanalyses. \n2.8. Physical activity \nAt baseline, physical activity was measured using pedometers \n(Omron HJ-003 and HJ-102, Omron Healthcare, Kyoto, Japan). \nParticipants were asked to wear these devices on the hip for 7 days. \nSteps per day was calculated for participants who had data recorded for \nmore than 4 days by taking an average of physical activity across the \ndays. \nA. Gandham, et al. Bone 140 (2020) 115546\n2\n\n2.9. Statistical analysis \nAll data analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 25 (IBM, NY, \nUSA). Proportions of obese and non-obese older adults deﬁned by both \nBMI and body fat percentage who experienced incident fractures (all vs \nnon-vertebral fractures) were compared using chi-squared tests. \nBaseline descriptive characteristics were compared between non-obese \nand obese older adults according to BMI and body fat percentage using \nindependent samples t-tests for continuous variables and chi-squared \ntests for categorical variables. \nBinary logistic regression and negative binomial regression were \nperformed to determine the likelihood and rate of incident fractures for \nobese older adults compared with non-obese, deﬁned by BMI and body \nfat percentage. These analyses were adjusted for: age and sex (Model 1), \nand additionally, total hip aBMD (Model 2) and additionally, smoking \nstatus, steps per day, number of comorbidities, bisphosphonates and \nbone active medications (Model 3). \nMultivariable linear regression was performed to compare di ﬀer-\nences in aBMD (total hip and lumbar spine), ALM, falls risk score, knee \nextension, leg strength and handgrip strength (all continuous variables) \nat baseline between obese and non-obese by BMI and body fat per -\ncentage. These analyses were adjusted for: age, steps per day, energy \nintake, smoking and total number of comorbidities at baseline. \nMediation analysis was also performed to determine the mediation \neﬀect of hip aBMD on the associations between BMI and body fat \npercentage with incident fractures. Path X corresponded to the eﬀect of \nBMI (a) and body fat percentage (b) on hip aBMD. Path Y corresponded \nto the eﬀect of hip aBMD on incident fractures. The total eﬀect captured \nthe direct (Z) and indirect (Z') e ﬀect pathway of BMI or body fat per -\ncentage on incident fractures through the mediator hip aBMD. In this \nanalysis, the percentage mediation was used to calculate the eﬀect size \nusing the formula: PM = XY/(XY + Z') = XY/Z [ 18]. \nBinary logistic regression was performed to determine univariate \nassociations of clinical risk factors with incident fractures in non-obese \nand obese older adults according to BMI and body fat percentage. \nClinical risk factors that demonstrated signiﬁcant (p-value < 0.05) as -\nsociations with incident fractures among any of the obese and non- \nobese groups were subsequently included in multivariable binary lo -\ngistic regression analyses. \nFor all analyses, p-value < 0.05 or 95% conﬁdence intervals not \nincluding the null point were considered statistically signiﬁcant. \n3. Results \nIn total, 1099 participants with a mean age of 63.0 ± 7.5 years \n(51.1% women) were enrolled at baseline. Among these participants, \n7.1% reported at least one incident fracture and 3.7% reported more \nthan one fracture. There were a total of 210 incident fractures over \n10 years, the majority (88.1%) of which were non-vertebral fractures. \nTable 1 presents comparison of baseline descriptive characteristics ac -\ncording to obesity status deﬁned by BMI and body fat percentage. The \nprevalence of obesity based on BMI classiﬁcations was lower (27.6%) \nthan the prevalence of obesity by body fat percentage (43.0%). Obese \nolder adults by body fat percentage, but not by BMI, were more likely to \nbe women and had lower physical function compared with non-obese \n(p-value < 0.05). Obese older adults by BMI, but not body fat percen -\ntage, had higher aBMD at the total hip and lumbar spine compared with \nnon-obese adults. Other di ﬀerences in descriptive characteristics be -\ntween non-obese and obese older adults were similar regardless of how \nobesity was deﬁned. \nProportion of incident fractures according to obesity status (non- \nobese vs obese) deﬁned by BMI and body fat percentage are presented \nin Fig. 1. Odds ratios and incidence rate ratios for all and non-vertebral \nincident fractures in obese compared with non-obese older adults de -\nﬁned by BMI and body fat percentage are presented in Table 2. Obese \nolder adults by BMI had 40–50% lower likelihood and rate of non- \nvertebral fractures after adjusting for age and sex (Model 1), but after \nfurther adjustment for total hip aBMD (Model 2), these associations \nwere no longer signiﬁcant. Obese older adults by body fat percentage \n(≥30% men; ≥40% women) had signiﬁcantly higher likelihood of all \nand non-vertebral fractures compared to non-obese after adjusting for \nconfounders including age, sex, hip aBMD, smoking status, steps per \nday, number of comorbidities, bisphosphonates and any bone active \nmedications at baseline (Model 3). However, as demonstrated in Sup -\nplementary Table 1 there were no substantial di ﬀerences in the like -\nlihood or rate of incident fractures between obese and non-obese par -\nticipants in the multivariable model when obesity was deﬁned using \nlower body fat percentage cut-o ﬀs (≥20% men; ≥35% women). \nMultivariable linear regression analyses ( Table 3 ) revealed that \nobese older adults by BMI, but not by body fat percentage, had sig -\nniﬁcantly higher lumbar spine aBMD and ALM, and lower falls risk \nscore compared to non-obese. However, obese older adults by body fat \npercentage, but not by BMI, had signiﬁcantly lower knee extension, leg \nstrength and hand grip strength compared to non-obese. \nMediation analysis (Fig. 2) demonstrated the relationship between \nBMI, body fat percentage and incident fractures with hip aBMD as the \nmediator. The percentage mediation ( PM) e ﬀect of 50.1% for BMI \nsuggested that total hip aBMD was a strong mediator for all fractures (p- \nvalue < 0.05). However, this was not observed for non-vertebral frac -\ntures and total hip aBMD did not mediate the e ﬀect of body fat per -\ncentage on all incident fractures. \nTable 4 presents univariable associations of baseline clinical risk \nfactors with incident fractures. Among all obese and non-obese groups, \nlower total hip aBMD was predictive of incident fractures (p-value < \n0.05). Higher falls risk score was predictive of incident fractures for \nobese older adults by both BMI and by body fat percentage. Lower ALM \nwas also predictive of fractures among non-obese older adults by both \nBMI and by body fat percentage. \nMultivariable binary logistic regression (Table 5) demonstrated that \nhigher falls risk score remained predictive of incident fractures for both \nobese by BMI and by body fat percentage. Higher leg strength was \npredictive of higher likelihood of incident fractures among non-obese \nolder adults by body fat percentage however, among non-obese by BMI \nlower handgrip strength was predictive of incident fractures. Lower \ntotal hip aBMD was predictive of higher likelihood of incident fractures \namong non-obese by body fat percentage. \n4. Discussion \nThis prospective study of community-dwelling older adults de -\nmonstrated that obesity deﬁned by body fat percentage was associated \nwith increased risk of incident fractures, whereas the protective e ﬀect \nof obesity deﬁned by BMI was primarily explained by higher aBMD. \nThis study also showed that falls risk score was a consistent predictor of \nincident fracture among obese older adults. These ﬁndings suggest that \nobesity should be classiﬁed according to relative adiposity, and that \nassessments of falls risk may have utility in predicting fracture risk \namong obese community-dwelling older adults. \nIncident fractures were more common among overweight compared \nto underweight and normal weight older adults. Consistent with this, a \nstudy of 5995 US men reported that most non-vertebral fractures (68%) \noccurred in those who were overweight or obese, and this appears to \nreﬂect the fact that a greater proportion of the older adult population is \noverweight or obese, rather than a protective beneﬁt of lower body \nweight for fractures [ 19]. Indeed, when comparing incidence of frac -\ntures between BMI groups in the present study, the likelihood of ex -\nperiencing an incident fracture was actually lower for obese older \nadults deﬁned by BMI, compared to non-obese. A study of 51,313 \nwomen aged 50 years and older also demonstrated that women with \nhigh BMI were at a lower risk of major osteoporotic fractures even after \nadjusting for aBMD [6]. We observed that the protective e ﬀect of high \nBMI for incident fractures was no longer signiﬁcant after adjustment for \nA. Gandham, et al. Bone 140 (2020) 115546\n3\n\nhip aBMD, suggesting that the lower fracture risk could be primarily \nexplained by their higher aBMD [20]. We also observed that the e ﬀect \nof BMI on fracture was mediated by aBMD, which was similarly re -\nported in the previous study, but we did not see a similar eﬀect of aBMD \non the relationship between body fat percentage and fracture [ 20]. \nThe diﬀerential eﬀects of high BMI and high body fat percentage \nmay be explained by the fact that high BMI is consistently associated \nwith greater aBMD, lean mass and physical function [21]. Higher body \nfat percentage appears to provide no advantage, however, and in some \ncases poorer values for these outcomes. In a study of 907 Korean \npostmenopausal women with a mean age of 65 years, BMI was posi -\ntively associated with aBMD and vertebral fractures whereas, body fat \npercentage was inversely associated with aBMD and was considered a \nrisk factor for vertebral fractures [ 22]. Another study of 6776 meta -\nbolically healthy adults demonstrated that high body fat percentage \nwas negatively associated with aBMD and bone health [23]. High body \nfat mass was also negatively associated with physical function, which \nmay increase the risk of falls and therefore fractures [24,25]. Thus, the \npurported fracture risk associated with obesity is likely to di ﬀer de -\npending on whether this is deﬁned by high BMI or high fat mass \nTable 1 \nBaseline descriptive characteristics according to obesity status. \nBMI Body fat percentage \nNon-obese (n = 796) Obese (n = 303) P-value Non-obese (n = 621) Obese (n = 471) P-value \nAge (years) 62.22 ± 7.62 62.50 ± 7.15 0.157 62.34 ± 7.53 63.90 ± 7.40 0.001 \nWomen (%)* 50 55 0.078 42 63 < 0.001 \nWeight (kg) 71.89 ± 10.96 93.66 ± 12.48 < 0.001 73.02 ± 12.68 83.89 ± 14.86 < 0.001 \nHeight (m) 167.35 ± 8.84 165.99 ± 9.43 0.030 168.73 ± 8.71 164 ± 8.91 < 0.001 \nBMI (kg/m2) 25.58 ± 2.60 33.98 ± 3.60 < 0.001 25.52 ± 3.13 30.87 ± 4.54 < 0.001 \nWait circumference (cm) 89.02 ± 10.36 107.48 ± 9.77 < 0.001 89.01 ± 10.80 100.53 ± 12.65 < 0.001 \nWaist/hip ratio 0.91 ± 0.09 0.96 ± 0.08 < 0.001 0.91 ± 0.09 0.94 ± 0.09 < 0.001 \nSteps/day 9006 ± 3331 7561 ± 3190 < 0.001 9391 ± 3323 7602 ± 3110 < 0.001 \nAlcohol (mL) 15.35 ± 19.61 13.65 ± 18.01 0.189 17.31 ± 20.54 11.68 ± 16.80 < 0.001 \nSmoking Current* 13 10 0.273 14 9 0.015 \nPhysical function (kg) \nHand grip strength 11.93 ± 2.99 12.10 ± 3.18 0.405 12.59 ± 3.06 11.17 ± 2.83 < 0.001 \nLeg strength 92.76 ± 47.42 92.57 ± 53.24 0.958 103.36 ± 49.66 77.95 ± 44.28 < 0.001 \nKnee extension 29.73 ± 10.94 30.56 ± 53.24 0.288 31.97 ± 11.15 27.29 ± 10.64 < 0.001 \naBMD (g/cm2) \nTotal hip 0.94 ± 0.15 1.05 ± 0.15 < 0.001 0.96 ± 0.17 0.97 ± 0.16 0.113 \nLumbar spine 1.00 ± 0.17 1.05 ± 0.17 < 0.001 1.02 ± 0.18 1.00 ± 0.17 0.162 \nBody composition \nALM (kg) 50.22 ± 9.89 57.21 ± 10.44 < 0.001 52.84 ± 10.52 51.20 ± 10.43 < 0.001 \nBody fat (%) 32.17 ± 7.51 38.91 ± 7.46 < 0.001 29.50 ± 6.37 39.95 ± 5.97 < 0.001 \nFalls risk score (z-score) 0.22 ± 0.87 0.10 ± 0.81 0.050 0.14 ± 0.85 0.24 ± 0.85 0.058 \nAll data expressed as mean ± standard deviation using independent samples t-test unless otherwise speciﬁed. *Chi-squared test.

This was also exempliﬁed in the present study where BMI was \nprotective as high BMI reduced likelihood of incident fractures whereas, \nhigh body fat percentage increased likelihood of incident fractures [2]. \nPredictors of incident fractures diﬀered among obese and non-obese \nolder adults by BMI and body fat percentage. A study of 2299 partici -\npants demonstrated that falls risk is an independent risk factor for \nfractures and should be utilised in fracture prediction tools.

A study of 1329 participants aged \n65 years and older demonstrated that physically ﬁt older adults had \nincreased risk of falling when participating in certain types of sports \ndemanding high-intensity activity patterns [ 29]. It should be noted \nhowever that while these associations were signiﬁcant in non-obese \nparticipants, their magnitude appeared to be small and did not diﬀer in \ndirection from that of obese participants. Lower total hip aBMD was \npredictive of higher likelihood of incident fractures only among non- \nobese older adults by body fat percentage suggesting that aBMD may be \na stronger predictor of fractures among non-obese older adults [ 30]. \nHowever, further longitudinal studies are required to conﬁrm these \nﬁndings and to investigate the underlying mechanisms contributing to \ndiﬀerences in fracture risk attributable to obesity status. \nThis study is subject to limitations including the relatively low \nnumber of fractures. The study was not designed to explore predictors \nof incident fractures among obese older adults and due to the low \nnumber of fractures observed, it is possible that a lack of statistical \npower inﬂuenced our results. There was substantial loss to follow-up \nduring the study period, and although we have previously reported that \nparticipants lost to follow-up in this cohort generally demonstrated \npoorer body composition, there were only minimal changes in the \nproportions of participants classiﬁed as obese at each time-point (data \nnot shown) [31]. Nonetheless, it is important to note that obesity status \nwas only determined at baseline, and it is possible that changes in body \ncomposition throughout the study inﬂuenced fracture outcomes [ 32]. \nIncident fractures were self-reported only every 2.5 to 5 years which \nmay be subject to reporting error. Also, there is no consensus deﬁnition \nof obesity according to body fat percentage and the use of diﬀerent cut- \noﬀs is likely to substantially inﬂuence associations and risk factors for \nfracture in those classiﬁed as obese; indeed, we observed that there was \nno association with fracture when lower cut-o ﬀs (that resulted in al -\nmost 80% of older adults being classiﬁed as obese) were utilised. It is \nlikely that other clinical factors not measured in this study could have \nutility in fracture prediction in obese older adults, and that the risk \nfactors included were assessed at one time-point only. \nIn conclusion, obesity deﬁned by BMI and body fat percentage have \nconﬂicting associations with likelihood of incident fracture. Incident \nfractures were more common among obese older adults when deﬁned \nby body fat percentage compared to by BMI. Fracture prediction \nmethods in obese older adults may be improved by using direct mea -\nsures of relative adiposity, as well as physiological assessments of falls \nrisk. \nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at https:// \ndoi.org/10.1016/j.bone.2020.115546. \nCRediT authorship contribution statement \nAnoohya Gandham:Writing - original draft, Writing - review & \nediting, Formal analysis.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed\nto determine whether older adults with sarcopenic obesity have increased risk of falls\nand fractures or lower bone mass compared with older adults with sarcopenia, obe-\nsity, or neither condition. Twenty-six studies (n = 37,124) were included in the sys-\ntematic review and 17 (n = 31,540) were included in the meta-analysis. Older adults\nwith sarcopenic obesity had lower femoral neck areal bone mineral density (aBMD)\ncompared with those with obesity alone but had higher femoral neck aBMD com-\npared with counterparts with sarcopenia alone (bothP < 0.05). Older adults with\nsarcopenic obesity had higher nonvertebral fracture rates (incidence rate ratio: 1.88;\n95% confidence intervals: 1.09, 3.23; based on two studies), compared with those\nwith sarcopenia alone, and also had higher falls risk compared with controls (risk\nratio: 1.30; 95% confidence intervals: 1.10, 1.54) and obesity alone (risk ratio: 1.17;\n95% confidence intervals: 1.01, 1.36). In conclusion, this systematic review and\nmeta-analysis has demonstrated that older adults with sarcopenic obesity are at\nincreased risk of adverse musculoskeletal outcomes compared with individuals with\nobesity, sarcopenia, or neither condition. These data support the need for developing\ninterventions to improve bone health and physical function in this population.\nKEYWORDS\nfalls, fracture, obesity, sarcopenia\n1 | INTRODUCTION\nOne third of adults aged≥65 years fall at least once every year and\napproximately 5% to 10% of these falls result in fractures that often\nlead to disability, frailty, and hospitalization.1,2 Almost 40% of older\nadults have obesity, and this is generally associated with normal or\nhigher areal bone mineral density (aBMD) and also results in increased\nfalls rates that may lead to an increased risk for fall-related injuries\nand certain types of fractures.3 A number of factors including poor\nbalance and higher risk of obesity-associated comorbidities may\ncontribute to increased falls and fracture risk in older adults with\nobesity.4–8\nPrevalence of sarcopenia, the age-related decline in skeletal mus-\ncle mass and function, varies based on the definition applied and can\nrange from 7% to over 50% in older adults. 9 According to the\nEuropean Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP)\ncriteria, prevalence of sarcopenia increases from 11% among older\nadults aged 50–59 years, to 37% among those aged 80 years and\nolder.10 Recent findings indicate that sarcopenia is negatively associ-\nated with aBMD and increases hospitalization as a result of falls and\nReceived: 15 September 2020 Revised: 14 November 2020 Accepted: 15 November 2020\nDOI: 10.1111/obr.13187\nObesity Reviews. 2021;1–13. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/obr © 2021 World Obesity Federation 1\n\nfractures.11,12 Older adults with the comorbid presence of sarcopenia\nand obesity, known as sarcopenic obesity, have reduced physical per-\nformance, increased risk of frailty and may be at a higher risk of\nadverse musculoskeletal outcomes compared with those with sar-\ncopenia, obesity, or neither condition.10,13 It has previously been\nreported that older adults with sarcopenic obesity have a threefold\nincreased risk for falls and fractures compared with counterparts with\nnonsarcopenic obesity (obesity alone) and nonsarcopenic nonobesity\n(controls).14 However, to date, no meta-analyses have investigated if\nolder adults with sarcopenic obesity represent a segment of the older\nadult community who should be specifically targeted for falls and\nfracture prevention programs.\nWe aimed to address this knowledge gap by performing a com-\nprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis comparing bone\nmass, falls risk, and fracture rates among older adults with sarcopenic\nobesity, obesity alone, sarcopenic nonobesity (sarcopenia alone), and\ncontrols.\n2 | METHODS\n2.1 | Search strategy\nThis systematic review was prospectively registered in the Interna-\ntional Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO)\n(CRD42019133773) and conducted in accordance with the Preferred\nReporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)\nguidelines.15 The electronic databases searched to November\n21, 2020, inclusive were EMBASE (1947 to present), PubMed (Ovid\nMedline 1946 to present), Web of Science, and Scopus. The search\nincluded keywords “sarcopenia,”“ obesity,”“ falls,”“ fractures,”\n“BMD,”“ older adults,” and related terms (Data S1). In addition, the\nreference list in each of the articles included in the review were exam-\nined to identify any additional related articles that met the inclusion\ncriteria.\n2.2 | Study screening and selection\nTwo independent reviewers (JM, AG) screened titles and abstracts of\nall articles against the inclusion and exclusion criteria after the com-\npletion of the search strategy. All potentially eligible articles had full\ntext screened against the inclusion and exclusion criteria and then\ndata were extracted from eligible studies. A third reviewer was con-\nsulted to resolve any disagreements (PJ).\nWe included randomized, quasi-randomized and observational\nstudies published in English which included adults aged≥50 years old\nand provided: a measure of bone mass or falls or fractures among\nolder adults with sarcopenic obesity compared with those with obe-\nsity alone, sarcopenia alone, or controls (or all three groups combined);\nany objective measurement of obesity and any definition of sar-\ncopenia was accepted. Participants who were referred to as having\n“dynapenia” (a term used to describe low muscle strength) were\nconsidered to have sarcopenia given our definition included low mus-\ncle mass, low muscle strength/physical performance, or both. Studies\nwere excluded if the participant population suffered from significant\ncomorbidities that are known to affect bone metabolism, for example,\ncancer. Articles were also excluded if they did not contain primary\ndata (e.g., reviews, abstracts, data studies, letters, books, case reports,\nmeetings, and editorials).\n2.3 | Data extraction\nThe following variables were extracted from articles independently by\ntwo reviewers (JM, AG) using Covidence: author, year of publication,\nnumber of participants, mean age, percentage of female participants,\nstudy design, type of population, obesity, and sarcopenia definitions,\nas well as falls, fractures, and aBMD outcomes. 16 When studies\nreported data for both participants with sarcopenia and dynapenia\nfrom the same population, only sarcopenia data were extracted. When\nstudies reported data for both participants with sarcopenic obesity\nand “osteosarcopenic obesity” (the presence of osteopenia/osteopo-\nrosis, sarcopenia and obesity) data for both groups were extracted\nprovided the two groups did not include the same individuals. We\ncontacted study authors three times over a period of 3 months due to\nmissing or insufficient data but those that did not provide additional\ndata were excluded from the meta-analysis.\n2.4 | Quality assessment\nThe quality of individual studies was independently assessed by two\nreviewers (JM, AG) using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) for\ncohort studies and a modified version of the NOS for cross-sectional\nstudy designs.17 Study quality was assessed based on the following\ncharacteristics: participant age, selection of nonexposed participants,\nassessment of falls, fractures and aBMD, definition of sarcopenia and\nobesity, any adjustment for confounding variables, and missing\ndata (Data S2). The scale varied based on the study design. Cohort\nstudy scores ranged from 0 to 10 based on above criteria and were\nclassified as high-quality if they scored ≥7 points. Cross-sectional\nstudy scores ranged from 0 to 8 based on the above criteria and as\nthere were no cut-offs available, a median of≥4 points was consid-\nered as high quality.17\n2.5 | Data analysis\nAggregated data were used, and an initial qualitative synthesis (sys-\ntematic review) was performed. We also performed a quantitative\nsynthesis (meta-analysis) to explore the associations between\nsarcopenic obesity, aBMD, falls, and fractures using Review Manager\n(RevMan) v5.3.18 Studies were included in each of the analyses more\nthan once to enable comparisons between individuals with sarcopenic\nobesity and each comparator (controls, sarcopenia alone, obesity\n2 GANDHAM ET AL.\n\n\nalone). Despite studies being included in forest plots more than once,\nthey were all independent of each other as we only presented subto-\ntal mean differences between older adults with sarcopenic obesity\ngroup and each comparator. Some studies compared only two groups\n(older adults with sarcopenic obesity versus all others) rather than all\nfour potential categories of sarcopenic obesity. In these cases, the\ncomparator group would include not only controls but also those with\nobesity alone and sarcopenia alone. Hence, we performed a sensitivity\nanalysis including only studies that compared all four groups for falls\noutcome. Additional subanalyses were performed based on study\nquality and sarcopenia definitions (studies that defined sarcopenia\nusing muscle mass assessment only versus studies that defined sar-\ncopenia using both muscle mass and strength assessments). Leave-\none-out sensitivity analysis was also performed for aBMD to evaluate\nif the study with the highest weight in each of the femoral neck ana-\nlyses was driving the significant associations.\nWe estimated raw mean differences for aBMD between groups.\nSimilarly, we estimated risk ratios and incidence rate ratios (95% con-\nfidence intervals) for falls and fracture data, with individuals with\nsarcopenic obesity group set as the reference. When studies reported\nboth crude and adjusted risk ratios or incident rate ratios, adjusted\ndata were used in the analyses. Meta-analyses were performed for\naBMD at the total hip, lumbar spine, femoral neck, and whole-body as\nwell as for falls risk and nonvertebral fractures using the random\neffects model. Studies that did not provide data were not included in\nthe meta-analysis and those studies that did not have the data in the\nrequired ratio format were converted into risk ratios or incident rate\nratios using the raw data provided in the studies via the calculator\nfunction in RevMan. 18 Heterogeneity between the studies was\nassessed using theI2 statistic where values≤25% were considered to\nreflect low heterogeneity, 26% to 75% as moderate and >75% as high\nheterogeneity.11,17 Publication bias was not assessed as there were\nless than 10 studies included in each of the meta-analyses.19\n3 | RESULTS\n3.1 | Search results\nFigure 1 is a flow chart of study selection. Twenty-six studies met all\ninclusion criteria and were included in this systematic review. A total\nof eight studies with falls, two studies with fractures, and 11 studies\nwith aBMD outcomes, were included in the meta-analysis.\n3.2 | Study characteristics\nTable 1 presents the characteristics of all 26 included studies\nincluded in the systematic review.

Older adults with sarcopenic obesity had signifi-\ncantly lower aBMD at the femoral neck compared with both controls\nand those with obesity alone (Figure 4). However, a leave-one-out\nsensitivity analysis (Figure S2) demonstrated that exclusion of the\nChung et al.23 study, which was given the highest weight (32% to\n62%) in this meta-analysis, resulted in a lack of significant mean\ndifference in femoral neck aBMD between individuals with sarcopenic\nobesity and controls.\nOlder adults with sarcopenic obesity had significantly higher\naBMD at all three sites compared with counterparts with sarcopenia\nalone (Figures 2–4). Older adults with sarcopenic obesity also had\nsignificantly lower whole-body aBMD compared with individuals\nwith obesity alone (mean difference: −0.04; CI: −0.06, −0.02) and\nalso had higher aBMD compared with older adults with sarcopenia\nalone (mean difference: 0.04; CI:0.01, 0.06) (data not shown). The\nassociations between total hip, lumbar spine, and femoral neck\naBMD among individuals with sarcopenic obesity versus compara-\ntors all reflected high heterogeneity (AllI2 > 85%). The associations\nbetween whole-body aBMD among individuals with sarcopenic obe-\nsity versus comparators however generally reflected low heteroge-\nneity (I2 = 0%). A subanalysis (Table 2) including only studies of high\nquality provided similar results to the primary analysis at the femoral\nneck and lumbar spine. Another subanalysis (Table S3) comparing\nassociations for different sarcopenia definitions demonstrated similar\nresults to the primary analysis for lumbar spine and femoral neck\naBMD. Sarcopenic obesity, defined by muscle mass only, or by mus-\ncle mass and strength, were both associated with lower femoral\nneck aBMD compared with controls, but higher lumbar spine aBMD\ncompared with sarcopenia alone. However, only sarcopenic obesity\nFIGURE 2 Forest plot reporting raw mean differences in total hip aBMD for older adults with sarcopenic obesity compared with controls\n(1.1.1), obesity alone (1.1.2), and sarcopenia alone (1.1.3). a: Men; b: women.

Subanalysis was per-\nformed with a total of six studies14,21,26,27,29,33 that provided falls data\nfor all four sarcopenic obesity categories in a forest plot (Figure S1),\nwhich provided similar results to the primary analysis. Subanalysis in\nstudies with high quality (Table 2) demonstrated that older adults with\nsarcopenic obesity showed similar falls risk compared with older\nadults with obesity alone counterparts. The associations with falls risk\namong individuals with sarcopenic obesity versus controls and sar-\ncopenia alone groups reflected medium heterogeneity (I2 = 51% and\nI2 = 33%, respectively), whereas associations for individuals with\nsarcopenic obesity compared with obesity alone reflected low\nheterogeneity (I2 = 24%).\n3.6 | Sarcopenic obesity and fractures\nOnly two studies14,40 were included in the forest plot investigating\nthe risk of nonvertebral fractures for older adults with sarcopenic obe-\nsity compared with each of controls, obesity alone, and sarcopenia\nalone groups (Figure 6). Older adults with sarcopenic obesity had 88%\nhigher nonvertebral fracture rates compared with counterparts with\nsarcopenia alone (IRR: 1.88; CI: 1.09, 3.23). The associations with frac-\nture rates among individuals with sarcopenic obesity compared with\ncontrols and individuals with obesity alone reflected medium hetero-\ngeneity (I2 = 62% andI2 = 51%), whereas associations for individuals\nwith sarcopenic obesity compared with sarcopenia alone reflected\nlow heterogeneity (I2 = 4%).\nFIGURE 3 Forest plot reporting raw mean differences in lumbar spine aBMD for older adults with sarcopenic obesity compared with controls\n(1.2.1), obesity alone (1.2.2), and sarcopenia alone (1.2.3). a: Men; b: Women.

Older\nadults with sarcopenic obesity have lower aBMD at the femoral neck\ncompared with counterparts with obesity alone, and higher falls risk\ncompared with those with obesity alone and controls. Importantly,\ndespite having higher aBMD at the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral\nneck, and a similar falls risk, compared with counterparts with sar-\ncopenia alone, our meta-analysis of two studies with incident fracture\ndata demonstrated their risk for nonvertebral fractures to be signifi-\ncantly higher than that of those with sarcopenia alone.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to synthesize\ndata on differences in falls, fractures and aBMD between older adults\nwith and without sarcopenic obesity. A recent systematic review and\nmeta-analysis (n = 52,838) examined the associations between sar-\ncopenia, falls, and fractures.17 The authors reported that older adults\naged ≥65 years with sarcopenia are at a higher risk of falls and frac-\ntures compared with nonsarcopenic counterparts.17 Further subgroup\nanalyses demonstrated that these associations were independent of\nfactors such as study design, population, sex, definition of sarcopenia,\ncontinent, and study quality. 17 Another meta-analysis among\ncommunity-dwelling older adults ( n = 31,513) also focused on\nassociations between sarcopenia and fractures and reported an\nincreased risk of incident fracture in men with sarcopenia compared\nwith nonsarcopenic men when sarcopenia was defined by the Asian\nFIGURE 4 Forest plot reporting raw mean differences in femoral neck aBMD for older adults with sarcopenic obesity compared with\ncontrols (1.3.1), obesity alone (1.3.2), and sarcopenia alone (1.3.3). a: Men; b: Women.

The pre-\nsent meta-analysis conducted on only two studies suggests that this\nprotective effect of obesity on nonvertebral fractures is likely to be\nlost in older adults who have comorbid sarcopenia, although larger\nstudies are required to determine whether this extends to hip frac-\nture. We observed that older adults with sarcopenic obesity have\nlower aBMD compared with controls and those with obesity alone\nbut have higher aBMD compared with those with sarcopenia alone.\nLow lean mass as a result of sarcopenia is associated with low aBMD,\nwhich likely explains the poorer bone health of older adults with\nsarcopenic obesity compared with both nonsarcopenic groups. 38\nHigher body mass in individuals with obesity provides additional\nmechanical loading on bone, which likely explains the higher aBMD\nwe observed in individuals with sarcopenic obesity compared with\ncounterparts with sarcopenia alone.48\nWe also observed that older adults with sarcopenic obesity are\nmore susceptible to falls compared with those with obesity alone and\ncontrols but have similar falls risk and increased nonvertebral fracture\nrates (88%) when compared with sarcopenia alone counterparts\n(Figure 6).14 It was notable that fracture risk was also higher in individ-\nuals with sarcopenic obesity compared with controls (32%) and those\nwith obesity alone (61%), although these differences were not signifi-\ncant (Figure 6). These findings could be influence by only two studies\nbeing included in the nonvertebral fracture analysis and their rela-\ntively small sample sizes. Nonetheless, although both sarcopenia and\nobesity have been associated with increased risk of falls,17,49 their\nrelationships with fractures are more controversial; obesity is gener-\nally considered to be protective but is associated with an increased\nrisk of certain fractures, including ankle and leg fractures.49,50\nThe absence of soft tissue padding in regions such as the ankle\nand lower legs may make these sites more vulnerable among individ-\nuals with obesity during a fall.50 However, BMI may not be truly rep-\nresentative of an individuals' adiposity as it does not differentiate\nbetween lean and fat mass. Recently, it has been demonstrated that\nFIGURE 5 Forest plot reporting risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals in falls risk for older adults with sarcopenic obesity compared with\ncontrols (1.4.1), obesity alone (1.4.2), and sarcopenia alone (1.4.3). Studies in the comparator group (controls) included not only controls, but also\nolder adults with obesity alone and sarcopenia alone individuals. Abbreviations: SO, sarcopenic obesity; CON, controls; O, obesity alone; S,\nsarcopenia alone\n10 GANDHAM ET AL.\n\n\nwhen obesity is defined directly by measures of adiposity using DXA,\nthere is no protective effect for fractures.51,52 Regardless, the evi-\ndence from this meta-analysis confirms that older adults with\nsarcopenic obesity represent a segment of the individuals with obesity\nwho are not protected from falls and fractures. Even in the presence\nof obesity, older adults with sarcopenia should be considered for\ninterventions including resistance exercises to improve bone\nhealth.53,54\nIt was somewhat surprising that despite falls risk being similar\namong individuals with sarcopenic obesity and sarcopenia alone, and\naBMD being significantly higher in those with sarcopenic obesity,\nthere was a significantly higher risk for nonvertebral fractures for\nthose with sarcopenic obesity compared with those with sarcopenia\nalone. The explanation for these controversial associations is unclear,\nbut it is likely that the advantage in aBMD observed in those with\nsarcopenic obesity compared with those with sarcopenia alone is at\nleast partly related to their higher body weight, providing greater\nmechanical loading of bone.55 Indeed, our meta-analyses demon-\nstrated that individuals with sarcopenic obesity generally had similar\naBMD to controls; the only exception was for femoral neck aBMD,\nbut a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis excluding the highest\nweighted study confirmed similar femoral neck aBMD between\ngroups. This suggests that higher fat mass may counteract the delete-\nrious effects of low muscle mass on aBMD through a mechanical load-\ning benefit, but further research is required to determine effects at\ndifferent skeletal sites. It is possible that the increased fracture risk for\nindividuals with sarcopenic obesity compared with sarcopenia alone\nindividuals is explained by compromised bone microarchitecture,\nwhich has been demonstrated in individuals with high adiposity.56\nFurther studies using advanced bone imaging techniques are required\nto better understand the effects of sarcopenic obesity on bone\nparameters beyond aBMD.\nThis study has limitations. Only two studies were included in\nthe nonvertebral fracture analysis, and fractures were self-reported\nand not radiographically confirmed in one of these studies, which\nmay be subject to reporting error and recall bias. It was only possi-\nble to explore associations with nonvertebral fractures and should\nbe acknowledged that associations of sarcopenic obesity with\nincident fracture at specific sites may differ. However, a strength\nof the falls and fracture analyses was that they included adjusted\nincident rate and risk ratios that considered potential confounding\nfactors. The included studies highlighted the lack of a consensus\ndefinition of sarcopenia or obesity, and it was necessary to include\nstudies with different diagnostic criteria. The definition applied for\nboth sarcopenia and obesity is likely to influence relationships with\nmusculoskeletal outcomes. Indeed, it was interesting to note that\nsarcopenic obesity, when defined by both muscle mass and\nstrength, demonstrated more differences in aBMD with other\ngroups than when defined by muscle mass alone (Table S3). This\nsupports the use of multicomponent definitions including both mus-\ncle mass and function in sarcopenia case finding. High heterogene-\nity observed for some of the analyses could possibly be explained\nby different age distributions, sarcopenia and obesity definitions,\nethnicities, and analyses not controlled for sex. Attempts were\nmade to contact authors of studies with missing data, but some\ndata were not provided. Due to the low number of studies, sub-\ngroup analyses based on age group, sex, and obesity definitions\nwere not performed. Subanalyses based on sarcopenia definitions\ncould not be performed for aBMD at the total hip, falls risk, or\nnonvertebral fracture rates.\nFIGURE 6 Forest plot reporting rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals in nonvertebral fracture rates for older adults sarcopenic obesity\ncompared with controls (1.5.1), obesity alone (1.5.2), and sarcopenia alone (1.5.3). Abbreviations: SO, sarcopenic obesity; CON, controls; O,\nobesity alone; S, sarcopenia alone\nGANDHAM ET AL. 11\n\n\nAlthough prevalence of sarcopenic obesity and understanding of\nits associated burden on older adults is increasing, it is still not clini-\ncally recognized. The lack of a consensus definition for sarcopenic\nobesity makes it challenging for clinicians to diagnose or treat older\nadults with this condition. Nonetheless, sarcopenic obesity is a poten-\ntially modifiable risk factor for a number of health conditions that can\nbe reversed through lifestyle interventions.57 Weight loss has contro-\nversial effects for older adults with obesity due to associated losses of\nmuscle and bone mass and increased fracture risk.4,58 Future studies\nshould focus on promoting healthy eating and targeted exercises such\nas high intensity resistance and impact training, in order to maintain\nand improve muscle and bone mass, while simultaneously undergoing\nweight loss to reduce adiposity.59–61\n5 | CONCLUSION\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that older\nadults with sarcopenic obesity have increased risk of falls and have\nlower aBMD at the femoral neck, compared with those with obesity\nalone. Despite generally having higher aBMD, older adults with\nsarcopenic obesity also have a higher risk of incident nonvertebral\nfractures compared with counterparts with sarcopenia alone, based\non a meta-analysis of two studies. These findings support the need\nto assess sarcopenic obesity status in the clinic and to improve\ntreatment guidelines for prevention of osteoporosis, falls, and\nfractures.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nNo conflict of interest statement.\nORCID\nAnoohya Gandham https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4469-0499\nJakub Mesinovic https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1297-2731\nREFERENCES\n1.

However, a majority of the studies in our systematic review and meta-analysis \nwere limited to Caucasian populations and studies in diverse populations are currently \nlacking. It is possible that ethnic differences in body composition, metabolism, diet, \nphysical activity, and genetics may contribute to differences in associations of \nsarcopenic obesity with musculoskeletal outcomes (318-320). \nEvidence from recent studies has indicated that there are sex differences in \nmuscle loss as there is a greater decline in muscle mass in men compared to women \nin older age (321). These differences may be explained by several factors including \nsex-differences in hormones, physical activity, and distribution of body fat (107, 322, \n323). With increasing multimorbidity and ageing of the population in India, it is \nnecessary to evaluate the effects of sarcopenic obesity on bone health to reduce the \nburden of this disease in this ethnic population of older adults . In this chapter we \ntherefore aimed to determine sex -specific differences in aBMD and BMAD among \nIndian older adults with obesity, sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity. \n \n \n \n \n\n 104 \nChapter 5.2 – Original Research \nGandham A, Scott D, Bonham MP, Kulkarni B, Kinra S, Ebeling PR, et al.

This study investigated sex-speciﬁc associations of obesity and sarcopenia with bone mineral density (BMD) and \nbone mineral apparent density (BMAD) among Indian older adults. 1057 adults aged /uni2265 50/uni00A0years were included. Dual-energy \nX-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measured BMD at the hip, spine and whole-body, and BMAD was calculated as BMD//uni221Abone \narea. Obesity was deﬁned by body fat percentage (cut points; > 25% for men and > 35% for women), and sarcopenia was \ndeﬁned using the revised Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia classiﬁcation with low hand grip strength (< 28/uni00A0kg for men \nand < 18/uni00A0kg for women) and appendicular lean mass index (< 7.0/uni00A0kg/m2 for men and < 5.4/uni00A0kg/m2 for women). Participants \nwere classiﬁed into four groups: controls (no obesity or sarcopenia), obesity, sarcopenia, or sarcopenic obesity. Linear \nregression (/uni03B2-coeﬃ cients and 95%CI) analyses were performed with adjustments for age, smoking status, protein intake, \nand socioeconomic status. Prevalence of sarcopenia (37%) and sarcopenic obesity (6%) were higher in men than women \n(17% and 4%, respectively). Compared with controls, men with obesity had lower whole-body BMD and BMAD, but women \nwith obesity had higher hip and spine BMD and BMAD (all p < 0.05). Men, but not women, with sarcopenic obesity, had \nlower hip and whole-body BMD and BMAD (all p < 0.05) than controls. Men with sarcopenia had lower BMD and BMAD \nat the hip only, whereas women had lower BMD at all three sites and had lower BMAD at the hip and spine (all p < 0.05), \ncompared with controls. Obesity, sarcopenia, and sarcopenic obesity have sex-speciﬁc associations with BMD and BMAD \nin Indian older adults. With the aging population in India, it is important to understand how body composition contributes \nto poor bone health among older adults.\nKeywords Sarcopenia/uni00A0· Obesity /uni00A0· Older adults /uni00A0· Bone\nIntroduction\nThe aging population of India is increasing at an exponential \nrate, and by 2050, 19% of the total population is predicted to \nbe aged 60/uni00A0years and over, comprising 324 million individu-\nals [1]. It is estimated that there will be parallel increases in \nchronic age-related diseases such as osteoporosis, and oste-\noporosis-related morbidity is likely to increase [ 2, 3]. Cur-\nrently, osteoporosis aﬀects 1 in 5 adults aged 18–59/uni00A0years in \nIndia, with the prevalence higher in women compared with \nmen [4, 5]. The onset of osteoporosis occurs approximately \n10–20/uni00A0years earlier in Indians compared with Western popu-\nlations, highlighting their increased risk for low bone min -\neral density (BMD) [5]. It is possible that ethnic diﬀerences \nin body composition, dietary patterns, and physical function \ncontribute to this increased prevalence among Indians com-\npared with Western populations [3, 4, 6].\n * Ayse Zengin \n Ayse.Zengin@monash.edu\n1 Department of/uni00A0Medicine, School of/uni00A0Clinical Sciences \nat/uni00A0Monash Health, Monash University, Clayton, VIC/uni00A03168, \nAustralia\n2 Institute for/uni00A0Physical Activity and/uni00A0Nutrition (IPAN), School \nof/uni00A0Exercise and/uni00A0Nutrition Sciences, Deakin University, \nGeelong, Australia\n3 Department of/uni00A0Nutrition, Dietetics and/uni00A0Food, Monash \nUniversity, Notting/uni00A0Hill, VIC, Australia\n4 Clinical Division, National Institute of/uni00A0Nutrition, Jamai \nOsmania PO, Hyderabad, India\n5 Department of/uni00A0Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, \nLondon School of/uni00A0Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, \nUK\n\n A./uni00A0Gandham et al.\n1 3\nSarcopenia is another age-associated condition and is deﬁned \nas the loss of skeletal muscle mass and function which increases \nthe risk of adverse musculoskeletal outcomes [7–10]. The preva-\nlence of sarcopenia for those aged > 45/uni00A0years is between 5 and \n39%, depending on the deﬁnition of sarcopenia [11]. Addition-\nally, the prevalence of sarcopenia is reported to be higher among \nIndian men than in women [11]. Obesity also continues to pose a \ngrowing threat to Indians with the prevalence expected to triple \namong adults aged between 20 and 69/uni00A0years by 2040, with more \nwomen than men aﬀected [12]. Obesity has been reported to \nhave a protective eﬀect on bone health, perhaps due to soft-tissue \npadding at certain sites [12]. However, studies have reported \nthat older adults with combined sarcopenia and obesity, known \nas “sarcopenic obesity”, have poorer bone health and physical \nfunction [8, 9]. As a result, older adults with sarcopenic obesity \nhave increased risk for morbidity, falls, and fractures [8–10, \n13–15]. Most of the studies exploring these relationships have \nbeen conducted in Caucasian populations [8, 9, 15]. Recently, \na study of 631 adults aged 65/uni00A0years and older from East China \nreported older men were more likely to have sarcopenia and \nsarcopenic obesity compared with women, when deﬁned by the \nAsian Working Group for Sarcopenia criteria [16]. In addition, \nit was also reported that older men with sarcopenic obesity were \nmore likely to have osteoporosis and dyslipidaemia, whereas \nwomen were more likely to have higher blood glucose, sug-\ngesting that there may be sex diﬀerences in the prevalence and \nadverse outcomes of sarcopenic obesity [16]. Likewise, another \nstudy with 1089 adults aged 50–79/uni00A0years reported that older \nwomen with sarcopenic obesity had higher BMD at the hip but \nmen had similar BMD compared to those with non-sarcopenic \nnon-obesity [9]. There is therefore a need for sex-speciﬁc analy-\nses of the eﬀects of sarcopenia and obesity on bone health.\nGiven the rapidly aging population in India, with concur-\nrent increases in morbidity and hospitalisation, it is impor -\ntant to understand the prevalence of sarcopenia and sarco -\npenic obesity [17]. Furthermore, no studies have previously \nexplored the associations of obesity, sarcopenia, sarcopenic \nobesity with bone health in an Indian population of older \nadults. To address this knowledge gap, we aimed to deter -\nmine sex-speciﬁc diﬀerences in BMD, bone mineral apparent \ndensity (BMAD), and the prevalence of osteoporosis, between \nIndian older adults with sarcopenic obesity, obesity alone, \nsarcopenia alone, and controls (no sarcopenia and obesity).\nMethods\nStudy Design and/uni00A0Participants\nData for participants aged /uni2265 50/uni00A0years from two studies, the \nIndian Migration Study (IMS) and Andhra Pradesh Children \nand Parents’ Study (APCAPS) were used for this analysis.\nIMS was conducted between 2005 and 2007 and ini -\ntially established to investigate the e ﬀects of rural–urban \nmigration on chronic disease risk in India among those aged \nbetween 15 and 76 /uni00A0years [ 17, 18]. All participants of the \nHyderabad arm of the IMS were invited to attend a clinic \nvisit to undergo a DXA scan at the National Institute of \nNutrition between January 2009 and December 2010. Eth -\nics approval was received for this study and was approved by \nthe All India Institute of Medical Sciences Ethics committee, \nthe National Institute of Nutrition, India and the London \nSchool of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK [18, 19]. All \nparticipants provided informed consent.\nThe APCAPS was originally established in 1987–1990 \nto study the long-term e ﬀects of early-life undernutrition \non risks of cardiovascular disease and was comprised of \nchildren and their mothers aged between 4 and 84 /uni00A0years \n[20]. The participants were followed up during multiple \ntime points and DXA was assessed at the second follow-up \nin 2009–2010. Ethics approval was received for this study \nand was approved by the National Institute of Nutrition, \nHyderabad. All participants provided informed consent [19].\nQuestionnaires\nAge, smoking status, education, and occupation types were \nself-reported using questionnaires. The highest level of edu-\ncation that was attained was categorized into four groups: \ncompleted graduate education, completed secondary school-\ning, completed primary schooling, and no education. Like -\nwise, the longest occupation held was categorized into four \ngroups: professional, skilled manual, unskilled manual, and \nunemployed. A validated, semi-quantitative food frequency \nquestionnaire was administered by an interviewer; protein \nintake data were used in our analyses [21].\nAnthropometry and/uni00A0Muscle Strength\nHeight (m) was measured to the nearest 0.1 /uni00A0m using a \nstadiometer (Seca Leicester height measure (portable), \nChasmors, UK). Weight (kg) was measured to the nearest \n0.1/uni00A0kg using an electronic scale (Seca Scales model 599) \nwith headgear, accessories, heavy items of clothing includ -\ning shoes and socks removed. Body mass index (BMI) (kg/\nm2) was calculated using weight (kg) divided by height \n (m2). Waist and hip circumference were measured to the \nnearest 0.1 /uni00A0cm using a measuring tape and used to calcu -\nlate the waist/hip ratio.\nHand grip strength was measured to the nearest kilo -\ngram using a pneumatic bulb dynamometer (Lafayette \nHand Dynamometer Model 78010 for APCAPS and grip \nD, Takei, Tokyo, Japan for IMS) [ 19, 20]. Participants \n\nSex Diﬀ erences in/uni00A0Bone Health Among Indian Older Adults with/uni00A0Obesity, Sarcopenia, and/uni00A0Sarcopenic…\n1 3\nwere required to use their maximum force by holding the \ndynamometer which was measured separately three times \nin APCAPS and four times in IMS in each arm and the \nmaximum value from the dominant arm was used in the \nanalysis.\nDual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA)\nWhole-body scans were performed to/uni00A0measure body compo-\nsition, including body fat percentage and lean mass using /uni00A0a \nHologic DXA (Hologic QDR 4500A, Waltham, MA, USA) \n[11]. Appendicular lean mass (ALM) was calculated as the \nsum of lean mass in/uni00A0the arms and legs (kg), and appendicular \nlean mass index (ALMI) was calculated as ALM divided by \nheight squared (kg/m2). DXA also measured BMD (g/cm2), \nbone area (cm), and bone mineral content (BMC, g) at the \nwhole body,/uni00A0total hip and lumbar spine.\nBMAD was calculated as BMD/ /uni221Abone area [ 22]. The \ncurrent study utilized BMAD as an additional measure of \nbone density in order to eliminate any confounding e ﬀects \nof short stature within the current study population of older \nadults [ 23, 24]. T-scores were calculated using hip BMD. \nOsteopenia was deﬁned as a T-score of −/uni00A01 to −/uni00A02.5 and \nosteoporosis as a T-score of less than −/uni00A02.5 (reference hip \nBMD: women = 0.901 ± 0.111/uni00A0g/cm2; men = 0.988 ± 0.131/uni00A0g/\ncm2), as previously recommended [25].\nSarcopenia and/uni00A0Obesity Deﬁnitions\nSarcopenia was deﬁned using the revised Asian Working \nGroup for Sarcopenia (AWGS) deﬁnition with low hand grip \nstrength cut points of < 26/uni00A0kg for men and < 18/uni00A0kg for women \nand ALMI cut points of < 7.0/uni00A0kg/m2 for men and < 5.4/uni00A0kg/\nm2 for women [ 26]. Obesity was deﬁned as BMI /uni2265 25/uni00A0kg/\nm2, consistent with current guidelines for the Indian popula-\ntion but given BMI may not be representative of adiposity \nand may therefore underestimate obesity, body fat percent -\nage, was utilized for the main analysis [ 7, 27–30]. Obesity \nwas deﬁned based on DXA-determined body fat percentage \nusing cut points of > 25% for men and > 35% for women \n[31, 32]. For this study, participants were classiﬁed as hav -\ning sarcopenic obesity, sarcopenia alone, obesity alone, or \nas controls (no sarcopenia and obesity) based on the above \ndeﬁnitions.\nStatistical Analysis\nAll data analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics \n25 (IBM, NY, USA). Characteristics of participants were \nreported separately for men and women as mean and stand-\nard deviations for continuous variables, or as percentages for \ncategorical variables, according to sarcopenia and obesity \ngroups. Chi-squared tests were performed to test diﬀerences \nin the proportion of older adults with osteoporosis, osteo -\npenia, or normal bone health according to sarcopenia and \nobesity groups.\nLinear regression analyses were performed for all partici-\npants and stratiﬁed by sex to evaluate di ﬀerences in BMD \nand BMAD among each of the four groups (sarcopenic obe-\nsity, sarcopenia alone, obesity alone, and controls). Older \nadults with sarcopenic obesity, obesity alone, and sarcopenia \nalone were compared with controls, and older adults with \nsarcopenic obesity were also compared with obesity alone \nand sarcopenia alone groups. Models were adjusted for con-\nfounders including age, protein intake and smoking status \n(Model 2), with a further adjustment for education and occu-\npation types (Model 3). A sensitivity analysis with further \nadjustments for waist and hip circumference in addition to \nthe confounders in Model 3 was performed in individuals \nwith obesity compared with controls (data not shown). For \nall analyses, p < 0.05 or 95% conﬁdence intervals not includ-\ning the null point was considered statistically signiﬁcant.\nResults\nIn total, 1057 participants (men = 715, women = 342), with \na mean age of 55.5 ± 4.9/uni00A0years, were included in this study \n(Table/uni00A01). A total of 304 older adults (17% men and 12% \nwomen) had obesity deﬁned by body fat percentage (regard-\nless of sarcopenia status) and a total of 376 older adults (29% \nmen and 7% women) had sarcopenia (regardless of obesity \nstatus). Using the BMI deﬁnition, there were 233 (13% men \nand 9% women) participants with obesity and 11 (1% men \nand 0.3% women) with sarcopenic obesity. DXA-determined \nbody fat percentage cut-points classiﬁed 247 (13% men and \n11% women) participants with obesity alone and 57 (4% \nmen and 1% women) with sarcopenic obesity. Women with \nobesity had higher body fat percentage (39.5%) compared \nwith men with obesity (28.9%). Both men and women with \nsarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity were shorter and had \nlower ALM and BMC at both the hip and spine, compared \nto those with obesity and controls (Table/uni00A01 ).\nA higher proportion of men with sarcopenia had osteopo-\nrosis at the hip compared with controls. Similarly, a higher \nproportion of men with sarcopenia had osteopenia compared \nto both controls and those with obesity. A higher proportion \nof women with sarcopenia had osteoporosis compared with \nboth control and obesity groups. Women with sarcopenia were \nalso more likely to have osteopenia than controls. A higher \nproportion of women with sarcopenic obesity had osteopenia \ncompared with both controls and obesity groups (Fig./uni00A01).\nMen with obesity had lower whole-body BMD and \nBMAD, respectively, compared with controls; in contrast, \n\n A./uni00A0Gandham et al.\n1 3\nTable 1 Participant characteristics by sarcopenia and/or obesity status\nMen (n = 715) Controls\n(n = 277)\nObesity\n(n = 135)\nSarcopenia\n(n = 261)\nSarcopenic \nobesity\n(n = 42)\nAge (years) 54.89 ± 4.03 54.70 ± 4.54 58.11 ± 5.81 58.48 ± 5.87\nWeight (kg) 57.99 ± 9.28 73.52 ± 10.01 45.81 ± 6.76 59.87 ± 9.06\nHeight (m) 1.64 ± 0.06 1.65 ± 0.06 1.60 ± 0.06 1.61 ± 0.08\nBMI (kg/m2) 21.57 ± 3.13 27.00 ± 3.08 17.83 ± 2.13 22.89 ± 2.57\nWaist circumference (cm) 79.88 ± 9.41 95.24 ± 8.32 70.31 ± 7.32 86.42 ± 7.75\nWaist/hip ratio 0.94 ± 0.06 0.95 ± 0.06 0.93 ± 0.06 0.94 ± 0.07\nEducational attainment (%)\n/uni00A0No education 154 (56%) 30 (22%) 217 (83%) 22 (52%)\n/uni00A0Primary schooling 57 (21%) 28 (21%) 29 (11%) 8 (19%)\n/uni00A0Secondary schooling 57 (21%) 63 (47%) 14 (5%) 9 (21%)\n/uni00A0Graduate education 9 (3%) 14 (10%) 1 (0.4%) 3 (7%)\nOccupation types (%)\n/uni00A0Unemployed 8 (3%) 15 (11%) 26 (10%) 8 (19%)\n/uni00A0Unskilled manual 4 (2%) 3 (2%) 4 (2%) 2 (5%)\n/uni00A0Skilled manual 219 (79%) 86 (64%) 215 (82%) 24 (57%)\n/uni00A0Professional 46 (17%) 31 (23%) 16 (6%) 8 (19%)\nBMC (g)\n/uni00A0Hip 36.10 ± 5.32 35.57 ± 5.17 31.89 ± 5.17 31.14 ± 5.09\n/uni00A0Spine 55.14 ± 14.68 55.27 ± 12.17 54.61 ± 17.96 50.16 ± 11.56\nBMD (g/cm2)\n/uni00A0Hip 0.936 ± 0.115 0.945 ± 0.108 0.846 ± 0.120 0.852 ± 0.098\n/uni00A0Spine 0.949 ± 0.197 0.952 ± 0.165 0.960 ± 0.170 0.887 ± 0.165\nBody composition\n/uni00A0ALM (kg) 19.71 ± 2.49 21.42 ± 2.94 14.77 ± 2.71 16.70 ± 2.22\n/uni00A0Body fat (%) 18.89 ± 4.36 28.94 ± 3.00 16.44 ± 4.21 28.46 ± 3.12\nWomen (n = 342) Controls\n(n = 157)\nObesity\n(n = 112)\nSarcopenia\n(n = 58)\nSarcopenic \nobesity\n(n = 15)\nAge (years) 53.83 ± 3.66 53.70 ± 3.15 55.10 ± 4.50 55.96 ± 6.01\nWeight (kg) 47.39 ± 7.40 63.23 ± 11.14 37.97 ± 4.28 48.72 ± 6.56\nHeight (m) 1.50 ± 0.05 1.51 ± 0.06 1.47 ± 0.05 1.46 ± 0.06\nBMI (kg/m2) 20.94 ± 2.89 27.46 ± 3.94 17.58 ± 1.87 22.99 ± 2.79\nWaist circumference (cm) 71.70 ± 8.24 87.43 ± 9.38 62.66 ± 5.86 78.80 ± 9.82\nWaist/hip ratio 0.83 ± 0.07 0.85 ± 0.06 0.75 ± 0.04 0.86 ± 0.11\nEducation (%)\n/uni00A0No education 148 (94%) 62 (55%) 58 (100%) 14 (93%)\n/uni00A0Primary schooling 6 (4%) 20 (18%) 0 (0%) 1 (7%)\n/uni00A0Secondary schooling 3 (2%) 21 (19%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%)\n/uni00A0Graduate education 0 (0%) 9 (8%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%)\nOccupation types (%)\n/uni00A0Unemployed 31 (20%) 61 (54%) 11 (19%) 7 (47%)\n/uni00A0Unskilled manual 8 (5%) 5 (4%) 2 (3%) 0 (0%)\n/uni00A0Skilled manual 116 (74%) 35 (31%) 43 (74%) 7 (47%)\n/uni00A0Professional 2 (1%) 11 (10%) 2 (3%) 1 (7%)\nBMC (g)\n/uni00A0Hip 23.21 ± 4.18 24.82 ± 4.82 19.84 ± 3.45 20.00 ± 1.97\n/uni00A0Spine 35.96 ± 8.82 39.54 ± 8.43 31.30 ± 8.27 33.17 ± 6.18\nBMD (g/cm2)\n/uni00A0Hip 0.758 ± 0.111 0.826 ± 0.126 0.670 ± 0.098 0.713 ± 0.060\n/uni00A0Spine 0.745 ± 0.147 0.811 ± 0.141 0.673 ± 0.151 0.714 ± 0.109\n\nSex Diﬀ erences in/uni00A0Bone Health Among Indian Older Adults with/uni00A0Obesity, Sarcopenia, and/uni00A0Sarcopenic…\n1 3\nwomen with obesity had higher BMD and BMAD at the hip \nand spine (all p < 0.05) after adjusting for all confounders \n(Table/uni00A02; model 3).

Similarly, women with \nsarcopenia also had lower hip, spine and whole-body BMD, \nand lower hip and spine BMAD (all p < 0.05, model 3). Fol-\nlowing adjustments, men with sarcopenic obesity had lower \nBMD and BMAD at the hip and whole-body (all p < 0.05) \ncompared with controls, while there were no signiﬁcant dif-\nferences in women in these groups. Men with sarcopenic \nobesity had lower whole-body BMD and BMAD compared \nwith those with sarcopenia after adjusting for all confounders \n(all p < 0.05). Likewise, in the total group (men and women \ncombined), those with sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity \nhad lower hip and whole-body BMD and BMAD compared \nwith controls (Supplementary Table /uni00A01). Individuals with \nobesity had higher hip BMAD but lower whole-body BMD \nand BMAD compared with controls (all p < 0.05).\nDiscussion\nIn this population of Indian older adults, men had /uni00A0a higher \nprevalence of sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity com -\npared with women. Sarcopenia was negatively associated \nwith bone health in both men and women, while obesity \nwas positively associated with bone health in women only. \nMen, but not women, with sarcopenic obesity had worse \nbone health than controls. These results suggest that there \nare sex-speciﬁc associations of body composition with bone \nhealth in older adults, and particularly, obesity does not oﬀ-\nset the negative eﬀects of sarcopenia on bone health in older \nFig. 1 Proportion of older men (i) and women (ii) with osteoporosis, \nosteopenia, or normal bone health at the hip based on sarcopenia/obe-\nsity groups.

Older Adults with/uni00A0Obesity, Sarcopenia, and/uni00A0Sarcopenic…\n1 3\nmen. In general, the eﬀects on BMD and BMAD were more \npronounced in Indian older adults with sarcopenia and sar -\ncopenic obesity.\nSarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity have been previously \nassociated with poor bone health and increased risk of \nfracture and there may be sex-speciﬁc di ﬀerences in these \nassociations [ 15, 16]. The current study is the ﬁrst we are \naware of to explore these associations in Indian older adults. \nWe observed that men with sarcopenic obesity had poorer \nBMD at the hip, spine, and whole-body compared with con-\ntrols. Similarly, a cross-sectional study in 213 men and 418 \nwomen from East China reported that older men, but not \nwomen, with sarcopenic obesity were more likely to have \nosteoporosis and poorer BMD at the hip and spine compared \nto those with obesity and those with neither sarcopenia nor \nobesity [16].\nObesity has been considered to have a protective e ﬀect \non bone health and osteoporosis [ 33]. In the current study, \nolder women with obesity had higher BMD and BMAD \nat the hip and spine compared with controls. In contrast, \nmen who were obese had worse BMD and BMAD at the \nwhole-body. There are established sex di ﬀerences in body \nfat distribution where men have more visceral fat than sub -\ncutaneous fat [ 34]. In this study, as a surrogate measure of \nsite-speciﬁc adiposity, we adjusted for waist and hip cir -\ncumference and showed that the di ﬀerences were attenu -\nated in women but not men. Among men, fat may mainly \nbe distributed in the trunk, but women may have a greater \ndistribution in the limbs and hip region [ 34, 35]. Women \nmay therefore have a greater absorption of impact forces \nby soft-tissue padding around the hip which may trans -\nlate to a bone-protective e ﬀect [34, 35]. Another possible \nexplanation could be that higher adiposity increases circu -\nlating estrogen levels in women and decreases testosterone \nlevels in men [ 36, 37]. Currently there are no data on sex \nhormones, body composition, and bone health in Indian \nadults, and this warrants further investigation [ 36, 37]. \nConﬂicting with the results of the current study, a recent \nmeta-analysis among ethnically diverse adults reported \nthat obesity may be more strongly positively associated \nwith BMD in men than women [ 38]. These contradictory \nﬁndings in the Indian population could be explained by \nethnic di ﬀerences in body composition, physical activity, \nnutrition, menopausal status, and hormone levels [ 38, 39]. \nIt is also possible that although individuals with obesity \nmay have increased areal/uni00A0BMD (aBMD)/uni00A0assessed by DXA, \nthey may have compromised bone microarchitecture and \nstrength which cannot be determined from DXA as it is \nlimited to two-dimensional measures of aBMD [ 7]. Recent \nﬁndings have also shown that excess soft tissue in those \nwith obesity leads to inaccuracies in DXA-determined \naBMD as the absorption of photons by the excess presence \nof fat around the bone causes a spuriously high reading \nof aBMD [ 40, 41]. Future studies should therefore utilize \nadvanced bone imaging modalities such as high-resolution \nperipheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) \nto investigate the /uni00A0underlying mechanisms between bone \nmicroarchitecture and obesity in order to better understand \nthis relationship in Indian older adults [ 7, 42]. Addition -\nally, these sex-speciﬁc associations may be due to dif -\nferences in the proportion of men ( n = 715) and women \n(n = 342) in this study. Together, these data suggest that \nhigh adiposity in men with sarcopenia does not provide \nthe same beneﬁcial e ﬀects on bone health seen in women.\nRecent studies have demonstrated a /uni00A0higher prevalence \nof sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity among men com -\npared with women in Asian populations [ 16, 43]. Simi -\nlarly, in the current study, men had a higher prevalence \nof sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity compared with \nwomen. Although men usually have higher muscle mass \nand strength due to di ﬀerences in sex hormones and body \ncomposition, the onset of muscle deterioration may occur \nmuch earlier and the magnitude of decline in muscle mass \nis greater compared with women, therefore increasing their \nrisk for sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity [ 16, 43, 44]. \nFuture studies should focus on evaluating the underlying \nmechanisms contributing to sex di ﬀerences in the preva -\nlence of sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity within diverse \npopulations.\nThe observed prevalence of sarcopenic obesity di ﬀered \nbased on the deﬁnition of obesity used. When obesity was \ndeﬁned by BMI, only 1% of the population had sarcopenic \nobesity as opposed to 5% when deﬁned by body fat percent-\nage. A recent study in 1640 children from north India found \nthat BMI misclassiﬁed 13–14% boys and 11–14.5% girls \ninto an incorrect adiposity category and therefore recom -\nmended the use of body fat percentage to deﬁne obesity [45]. \nSimilarly, in a study of 1217 Vietnamese individuals, BMI \nwas found to underestimate the prevalence of obesity and it \nwas concluded that the use of body fat percentage might be \nData presented as /uni03B2-coeﬃ cients and 95% conﬁdence intervals.

The under-\nestimation of obesity status by BMI is likely explained by \nthe fact that those with high BMI may often have greater \nlean mass than those with low BMI. Those with high BMI \nmay therefore be less likely to have concomitant sarcopenia \nas opposed to when obesity is deﬁned by body fat percent -\nage [28, 29]. In a study of 804 community-dwelling healthy \nIndian adults, body fat percentage was reported to be a bet-\nter diagnostic criterion for sarcopenic obesity as it assesses \nbody fat distribution unlike other methods such as by BMI \nor waist circumference [10]. Although consensus deﬁnitions \nof sarcopenic obesity are not currently available, it would \nappear that the obesity component should be deﬁned where \npossible using direct estimates of adiposity such as by DXA.\nThe strengths of this study includes a well-characterized \npopulation from a large cohort of Indian older adults, with \ndirect measurements of body composition and bone den -\nsity. There are some limitations to this study. Firstly, the \nproportion of women (32%) in this study was much lower \ncompared with men (68%). This di ﬀerence in proportions \nmay possibly explain the lack of associations between \nbone health and sarcopenic obesity in women, as low \nnumbers of women were classiﬁed with sarcopenic obesity \n(n = 15). All study participants resided in Hyderabad, India \nand the results may not be generalized to other regions \nof India, where there are established di ﬀerences in life -\nstyle, and environmental factors [ 38]. It is also possible \nfor shifts in urbanization and lifestyle habits over time and \nthese ﬁndings may therefore not be representative of the \ncurrent population at the present time. Other confounders \nwhich were not assessed in these studies, including physi -\ncal activity measured with the gold-standard triaxial accel -\nerometer, could have inﬂuenced the associations between \nobesity, sarcopenia, sarcopenic obesity, and bone health. \nTwo diﬀerent dynamometers were used to measure hand -\ngrip strength in the two studies which may have introduced \nvariation. The current study utilized DXA-derived bone \nparameters and an additional computed measure, BMAD \nas a measure of bone health. In addition to DXA, the use of \nother bone imaging devices to measure bone microarchi -\ntecture such as HR-pQCT may provide better insights in \nunderstanding the underlying relationship between obesity \nand bone health. Hand grip strength was the only measure \nof physical function. Other assessments of physical func -\ntion such as gait speed, chair stand rise, stair climb test, \nor timed up and go test would be useful as it may contrib -\nute to further understanding the di ﬀerences in poor bone \nhealth. Finally, since there is no consensus deﬁnition for \nsarcopenia, the current study utilized the revised AWGS \ndeﬁnition as it is the recommended criteria in Asian pop -\nulations [ 26]. It should be noted that the current study \nutilized the AWGS cut points for hand grip strength even \nthough di ﬀerent dynamometers were utilized in this study \nas AWGS did not propose dynamometer-speciﬁc cut points \nand may therefore not be comparable with other studies \n[47]. Also, the use of diﬀerent sarcopenia deﬁnitions could \ninﬂuence both prevalence and associations.\nIn conclusion, in Indian older adults, there are sex-\nspeciﬁc associations between obesity, sarcopenia, and \nsarcopenic obesity with bone health. Men with sarco -\npenic obesity have worse bone health, but both men and \nwomen with sarcopenia had poorer bone health compared \nwith those without sarcopenia and obesity. Obesity may \nbe associated with better bone health in women but not \nmen. Future studies should investigate how sex di ﬀerences \nin body composition contributes to poor bone health and \ndetermine how they can reduce the risk of falls and frac -\ntures among Indian older adults.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplemen -\ntary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s00223- 022- 00981-1.\nAcknowledgements We acknowledge the eﬀorts of IMS and APCAPS \nparticipants and staﬀ.\nAuthor Contributions AG: writing—original draft, writing—review \nand editing, formal analysis.

DXA cannot distinguish between cortical and trabecular bone as it does not have \nthe ability to assess bone microarchitecture , which may be differentially affected by \nobesity and sarcopenia. The use of three-dimensional imaging modalities such as HR-\npQCT may therefore provide valuable information about the effects of sarcopenic \nobesity on bone health. \nThis is important because recent evidence has demonstrated that older adults \nwith obesity, despite having higher aBMD, have an increased risk for certa in types of \nfractures, which may be explained due to alterations in their bone microarchitecture. \nIndeed, Chapter 4.2 has demonstrated that older adults with sarcopenic obesity had \nhigher aBMD but a higher risk of non -vertebral fractures compared to those with \nsarcopenia alone, which may be explained by differences in bone microarchitecture . \nSimilarly, in Chapter 5.2 , there were sex differences in the associations between \nobesity, sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity in Indian older adults, which could be due \nto differences in bone microarchitecture. There is however limited evidence on how \ncomponents of sarcopenic obesity associate with bone health estimated by advanced \nimaging modalities such as HR -pQCT. This chapter therefore aimed to determine \nassociations of BMI, body fat percentage and components of sarcopenia (muscle \n\n 116 \nmass and muscle strength/power) with bone variables assessed by HR-pQCT and \nDXA among older adults with obesity. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 117 \nChapter 6.2 – Original Research \nUnder review in Experimental Gerontology \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nAssociations of body mass index, body fat percentage and sarcopenia \ncomponents with bone health estimated by second-generation high-resolution \nperipheral quantitative computed tomography in older adults with obesity \n \n \nAnoohya Gandham1, Jakub Mesinovic 1,2, Mavil May Cervo 1, Costas Glavas 2, Paul \nJansons1,2, Carrie -Anne Ng 1, Juan Pena Rodriguez 1, Ayse Zengin 1, Maxine P \nBonham3, Peter R Ebeling1, David Scott1,2 \n \n1 Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Sciences at Monash Health, Monash \nUniversity, Clayton, Victoria, Australia \n2 Institute for Physical Activity and Nutrition (IPAN), School of Exercise and Nutrition \nSciences, Deakin University, Geelong, Australia \n3 Department of Nutrition, Dietetics and Food, Monash University, Notting Hill, Victoria, \nAustralia \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCorresponding Author: \nAnoohya Gandham \nDepartment of Medicine, School of Clinical Sciences at Monash Health, Monash \nUniversity, Clayton, Victoria, Australia 3168 \nEmail: anoohya.gandham@monash.edu \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nAbstract \nPurpose: To investigate associations between body mass index (BMI), body fat \npercentage, and components of sarcopenia (muscle mass and muscle \nstrength/power), with bone microarchitecture measured by high -resolution peripheral \ncomputed tomography (HR-pQCT) in older adults with obesity. \nMethods: Seventy-four adults aged ≥55 years with body fat percentage 30% (men) \nor 40% (women) were included. Fat mass, lean mass and total hip, femoral neck, \nand lumbar spine areal bone mineral density (aBMD) were measured by dual -energy \nX-ray absorptiometry. Appendicular lean mass (ALM) was calculated as the sum of \nlean mass in the upper - and lower -limbs. BMI was calculated and participants \ncompleted physical function assessments including stair climb power test. Distal tibial \nbone microarchite cture was assessed using HR -pQCT. Linear regression (β -\ncoefficients and 95% confidence intervals) analyses were performed with adjustment \nfor confounders including age, sex, smoking status, vitamin D and self -reported \nmoderate to vigorous physical activity. \nResults: BMI and ALM/height2 were both positively associated with total hip, femoral \nneck and lumbar spine aBMD and trabecular bone volume fraction after adjusting for \nconfounders (all p<0.05). Body fat percentage was not associated with aBMD or any \ntrabecular bone parameters but was negatively associated with cortical area (-\n1.647mm2; -3.127, -0.167). Stair climb power (indicating better performance) was \npositively associated with cortical area and negatively associat ed with bone failure \nload (both p<0.05). \nConclusion: Higher BMI, ALM/height2 and muscle power were associated with more \nfavourable bone microarchitecture, but higher body fat percentage was negatively \nassociated with cortical bone area. These findings suggest that high BMI may be \n\n \nprotective for fractures and that this might be attributable to higher muscle mass and/or \nforces, while higher relative body fat is not associated with better bone health in older \nadults with obesity. \n \nKeywords: obesity, bone, muscle, older adults \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nIntroduction \n Obesity and osteoporosis are major public health concerns among older adults, \ncontributing to poor quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality (1, 2). It has \nbeen projected that by 2025, more than three -quarters of Australian adults will be \noverweight or have obesity (3). Likewise, i t is estimated that by 2022, 25% of \nAustralians aged >50 years will have osteopenia or osteoporosis (2). \nThe relationship between obesity and bone health is controversial (4-6). Higher \nbody mass index (BMI) is protective against osteoporosis due to greater mechanical \nloading, which stimulates bone remodelling and increases areal bone mineral density \n(aBMD) (5, 7). BMI is the most widely used measure of obesity, but it does not \ndifferentiate between fat and lean mass and may underestimate the prevalence of \nobesity among older adults (5, 8, 9). Body fat percentage assessed from dual-energy \nX-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is a direct measure of adiposity and higher body fat \npercentage, in contrast to BMI, has been found to be associated with increased risk \nfor incident fracture in older adults (5, 9). Although, m any studies have reported \npositive associations between BMI and aBMD among older adults, very few have \nexplored associations between BMI and cortical and trabecular bone \nmicroarchitecture in this population (10-12). It is necessary to understand the \nunderlying mechanisms contributing to adverse musculoskeletal health outcomes \namong this population of older adults as despite having high aBMD their bone \nmicroarchitecture may be compromised. It is therefore important to evaluate \nassociations of BMI and body fat percentage with bone health using advanced bone \nimaging modalities (13). \nSarcopenia is defined as an age-associated loss of skeletal muscle mass and \nfunction and older adults with sarcopenia and obesity (‘sarcopenic obesity’) have an \n\n \nincreased risk for falls and fractures compared with those with obesity alone and \nhealthy controls (with neither sarcopenia or obesity ) (13-15). However, to date most \nresearch exploring relationships between sarcopenia, obesity and bone health have \nfocused on two -dimensional aBMD measurements, while little is known about the \ninfluence of sarcopenia components and adiposity on volumetric BMD (vBMD) and \nbone microarchitecture variables in older adults with obesity. \n The aim of this cross-sectional study of older adults with obesity was to explore \nassociations of BMI, body fat percentage, and components of sarcopenia (muscle \nmass, function and power) with bone health measured by DXA and bone \nmicroarchitecture variables measured by second-generation high-resolution \nperipheral computed tomography (HR-pQCT), respectively. \n \nMethods \nStudy design and participants \n This cross-sectional analysis utilized a convenience sample of older adults with \nobesity with baseline data from three randomised controlled exercise trials conducted \nat the Monash Health Translation Precinct in Melbourne, Australia \n(ACTRN12618001146280; ACTRN12616000563460; ACTRN12618000192280) . \nSeventy-four community-dwelling older adults aged 5 5-83 years, residing in \nMelbourne, Australia, were recruited via flyers and online advertisements. Participants \nwith body fat percentage (assessed by DXA) 30% (men) or 40% (women) were \nincluded in this study (16). Exclusion criteria included inability to walk 400 metres \nunassisted (without the use of walking aids); inability to speak English, diagnosis of \nany progressive neurological disorders, severe knee or h ip osteoarthritis (awaiting \njoint replacement), lung disease s requiring the use of oxygen, renal kidney disease \n\n \nrequiring dialysis or any other disorder of severity that life expectancy was less than \n12 months. \n The studies were conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of \nHelsinki and were approved by the Monash Health Human Research Ethics \nCommittee (Protocol ID: HREC/15/MonH/182 ; HREC/17/MonH/613; \nHREC/18/MonH/399) and all participants provided written informed consent. \n \nQuestionnaires \n At baseline, participants completed self -administered questionnaires including \nquestions on demographics, smoking status, and moderate to vigorous physical \nactivity. Total number of days of moderate to vigorous physical activity was assessed \nusing the International Physical Activity Questionnaire for the Elderly (IPAQ -E) (17, \n18). \n \nAnthropometry \n Weight (kg) was measured to the nearest 0.1kg using an electronic scale (Seca \n804 electronic scales, Seca, Hamburg, Germany) and height (m) was measured to the \nnearest 0.1m using a stadiometer (Seca 213 wall -mounted stadiometer, Seca, \nHamburg, Germany) with footwear and heavy items of clothing removed. BMI was \ncalculated as weight (kg)/ height (m 2). Waist and hip circumference were measur ed \nthree times and the average of the three measurements was calculated to the nearest \n0.1cm using a measuring tape (Seca 203) and used to calculate waist/hip ratio. Waist \ncircumference was measured at the level of the mid-point between the inferior margin \nof the last rib and the crest of the ilium in the mid -axillary plane. Hip circumference \nwas measured at the level of the greatest posterior protuberance of the buttocks. \n\n \nBlood Biochemistry \nBlood samples were collected following an overnight fast of 10 hours. Serum \nsamples were analysed for levels of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) (19) using a \nDiaSorin Liaison (DiaSorine Inc, Stillwater, MN, USA) direct competitive \nchemiluminescent immunoassay with inter -assay and intra -assay coefficient of \nvariation (%CV) of 10.7% and 6.5%, respectively. \n \nPhysical Function \n Hand grip strength was measured using a hydraulic dynamometer (Jamar Plus \ndynamometer, Patterson Medical, Bolingbrook, IL, USA). Participants gripped the \ndynamometer with maximal force in a seated position with their elbow at a 90 angle. \nParticipants repeated this measurement three times in the dominant arm with a 30 -\nseconds rest between trials and the mean force of the second two trials was used to \ncalculate average hand grip strength. \n Participants completed the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) test \nwhich consists of gait speed, chair stand and standing balance assessment s and a \ncomposite score of 0-12 (higher score indicating better function) was given based on \nthe performance in three assessments (20, 21). For chair stand test, participants were \ninstructed to stand up straight from a seated position five times as quickly as possible \nand the time taken (seconds) was recorded. Tests were aborted after one minute, or \nif the participants utilised their arms and failed to come to a complete standing position. \nBalance assessments consisted of semi-tandem and full-tandem stand. For the semi-\ntandem position, participants were required to stand with the heel of one foot placed \nbeside the big toe of the opposite foot and hold that position for 10 seconds. For the \nfull-tandem position, participants were required to place their preferred foot in front of \n\n \nthe other with the back of the heel of one foot touching the toes of the other foot. \nParticipants who were unable to complete the semi-tandem stand for 10 seconds were \nrequired to stand with both feet side -by-side instead (22). Gait speed was assessed \nover different walking course distances in the three studies . A correction factor was \ntherefore applied to studies that measured gait speed over a 2.44m distance to convert \nto 4m gait speed using previously developed methodologies (21). As an additional \nfunctional measure of muscle power, participants also completed a 10-step stair climb \npower test (23). In a safe manner, participants were instructed to climb the stairs as \nfast as possible (participants were allowed to use the h andrail if required) . This \nassessment was completed twice after a 1-minute recovery period after the first trial , \nand the average of the time taken was recorded using a stopwatch. The following \nformula was utilised to calculate stair climb power : force X v elocity (23). Force was \ncalculated as the product of participants body mass (kg) and acceleration due to \ngravity (9.8m/s 2). Velocity was calculated as the vertical height of stairs (1.75 m) \ndivided by stair climb power test time (s) (23). \n \nDual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) \nWhole-body DXA scans measured body composition parameters including body fat \npercentage and lean mass (Hologic Discovery A, Hologic, USA). Appendicular lean \nmass (ALM) was calculated as the sum of lean mass in the upper- and lower-limbs. \nAll scans were performed in the morning with participants either fasted or having \nconsumed a light snack. The DXA scanner was calibrated daily using the \nmanufacturer’s spine phantom. DXA scans also measured aBMD at the lumbar \nspine, femoral neck and non-dominant total hip . Osteopenia was defined as a T-\nscore between -1 and -2.5 and osteoporosis as a T-score of ≤ -2.5 at the total hip \n\n \n(24). Lumbar spine trabecular bone score (TBS) was determined using TBS iNight \nsoftware version 3.0.2 (Medimaps, Switzerland). Individuals with BMI ≥37kg/m2 were \nexcluded from the analysis using the TBS data (25). %CV for scans repeated on 30 \nindividuals in our laboratory was 0.90% for aBMD at the whole-body and 0.96% for \nwhole-body total fat. \n \nSarcopenia definition \n Sarcopenia was defined using both the Sarcopenia Definitions and Outcomes \nConsortium (SDOC) and revised European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older \nPeople (EWGSOP2) definitions (14, 26). SDOC is defined as low hand grip strength, \nwith cut points of <35.5kg for men and <20kg for women, and low gait speed (<0.8m/s) \n(14). EWGSOP2 is defined as low appendicular lean mass index (< 7kg/m2 for men \nand <5.50kg/m2 for women) and low hand grip strength (<27kg for men and <16kg for \nwomen) or slow chair stands time ( >15 seconds for five rises ) (26). Two definitions \nwere utilised to compare differences in prevalence of sarcopenia in this group of older \nadults. \n \nHigh-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) \nHR-pQCT scans were performed on the non -dominant distal tibia to estimate \nbone microarchitecture and strength (XtremeCT II, ScanCo, Swtizerland) (27, 28). A \ntwo-dimensional scout view scan was used to identify the region of interest (22.5mm \nproximal to the reference line placement at the end plate of the tibia). Participant’s leg \nwas positioned into the scanner using the manufacturer -provided cast to prevent \nmovement artefact. One hundred and sixty-eight parallel computed tomography slices \n\n \nwere obtained over a 10.20mm region of the distal tibia using an isotropic r esolution \nof 61m. \nHR-pQCT images were analysed according to the manufacturer evaluation \nprotocol to measure cortical and trabecular bone variables using software version 6.1 \n(29). Scans were graded according to a 5 -point scale to account for any motion \nartifacts (1=perfect, 5=severe motion artifact) (30). A semi-automated slice-by-slice \ncontouring was also performed on all scans to extract the bone region from the \nsurrounding soft tissue and manual corrections were applied where necessary (31). \nBone variables included: cross-sectional area (mm2), total vBMD (mg HA/cm), cortical \narea (mm2), cortical volumetric BMD (vBMD; mg HA/cm), cortical porosity (%), cortical \nthickness (mm), trabecular area (mm 2), trabecular vBMD (mg HA/cm), trabecular \nthickness (mm), trabecular separation (mm), trabecular bone volume fraction (%) and \ntrabecular number (1/mm) (31). Micro-finite element analysis was performed for bone \nstrength estimates such as bone stiffness (N/mm) (total reaction force of the model \ndivided by the applied displacement) and bone failure load (N) (an indirect estimate \nfrom linear finite element models using a yield criterion) (27, 28, 31). %CV, estimated \nby repeated scans performed on 30 individuals in our laboratory, was 0.62% for total \nvBMD, 1.10% for cortical area, 0.71% for cortical vBMD, 1.34% for cortical thickness, \n1.07% for trabecular area, 0.59% for trabecular vBMD, 0.97% for trabecular thickness, \n2.47% for trabecular separation, 3.37% for trabecular number, and 0.82% for \ntrabecular bone volume. \n \nStatistical Analysis \n All data analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 25 (IBM, NY, USA). \nParticipant characteristics were reported as mean and standard deviations for \n\n \ncontinuous variables, or as percentages for categorical variables. Mean and standard \ndeviations for all bone parameters determined by the DXA and HR -pQCT were \npresented for all participants (Supplementary Table 1). \n Scatterplots and Pearson’s correlation analyses were performed with no \nadjustment for confounders to evaluate relationship s between BMI, body fat \npercentage, ALM /height2 and HR -pQCT-determined bone parameters . Linear \nregression analysis was performed to evaluate the associations between components \nof obesity , sarcopenia, and physical function with DXA- and HR-pQCT-determined \nbone parameters. Adjustment for confounders includ ed age, sex, smoking status, \nvitamin D and self-reported moderate to vigorous physical activity. \nMediation analysis was performed to evaluate whether muscle mass/forces \nmediated associations between BMI and bone microarchitecture (trabecular vBMD, \ntrabecular BV/TV and trabecular number). Path X corresponds to the effect of BMI on \n(a) muscle mass (ALM/height2) (b) muscle force (stair climb power test) . Path Y \ncorresponds to the effects of (a) muscle mass (ALM/height2) (b) muscle force (stair \nclimb power test) on bone microarchitecture. The total effect captured by direct (Z) \nand indirect (Z’) effects wi th the mediator muscle mass/force. The percentage \nmediation was used to calculate the effect size using the formula: P M = XY/(XY+Z’) \n(32). \n For all analyses, p<0.05 or 95% confidence intervals not including the null point \nwas considered statistically significant. \n \nResults \nIn total, 7 4 participants (62% women) were included in this cross -sectional \nstudy with an age range of 5 5 to 83 years (Table 1). Twenty-eight (38%) participants \nhad a SPPB score of 12/12. Ten participants did not have TBS, total hip, femoral neck \n\n \nor lumbar spine BMD data and were therefore excluded in analyses using those data. \nIn addition, 16 participants had a BMI ≥37kg/m2 and were therefore excl uded in \nanalyses using the TBS data. Six participants had confirmed sarcopenia according to \nthe EWGSOP2 definition (both low ALM and low hand grip strength ). Three \nparticipants had slow chair stand time and no participants had both low ALM and low \nchair stand time according to the EWGSOP 2 definition. However, only 3 (4%) \nparticipants had sarcopenia defined by the SDOC definition ( both low hand grip \nstrength and low gait speed). \nFigure 1 presents correlations for ALM/height2, BMI and body fat percentage \nwith tibial trabecular and cortical vBMD estimated by HR-pQCT. There was a positive \ncorrelation between ALM/height2 and tibial trabecular vBMD (p=0.037). However, after \nadjusting for confounders in linear regression analyses (Table 2), the associations \nbetween BMI and tibial trabecular vBMD were significant (R 2 = 0.094) however, the \nassociations between ALM/height 2 and tibial trabecular vBMD were no longer \nsignificant (R 2 = 0.104 ). In addition, after adjusting for confounders , BMI and \nALM/height2 were both positively associated with total hip, lumbar spine and femoral \nneck aBMD and tibial trabecular bone volume fraction. Conversely, b ody fat \npercentage was negatively associated with tibial cortical area. Components of \nsarcopenia including muscle strength, function and power had varying associations \nwith bone parameters. Stair climb power test was positively associated with total hip \naBMD, cortical area and bone stiffness after adjusting for confounders and hand grip \nstrength was positively associated with tibial cross-sectional area . However, gait \nspeed and chair stand test times were not associated with any bone microarchitectural \nvariables. In addition, SPPB was positively associated with tibial bone failure load, \nbone stiffness and cortical porosity. A sensitivity analysis exploring the associations of \n\n \nBMI with bone parameters after further adjustment for ALM/height 2 and stair climb \npower test resulted i n all associations being non -significant (all p>0.05; data not \nshown). \nMediation analysis (Figure 2 and 3) investigated the relationships between BMI \nand trabecular bone microarchitecture with ALM/height 2 (Figure 2) and stair climb \npower test (Figure 3) as the mediator. After adjusting for age, the percentage \nmediation (PM) effect between 49% to 58% suggested that stair climb power test was \na strong mediator of the association between BMI and trabecular bone \nmicroarchitecture. However, ALM/height2 did not mediate the effect of BMI on \ntrabecular bone microarchitecture (p>0.05). \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nIn this population of older adults with obesity, BMI, ALM/height2 and stair climb \npower were associated with more favourable aBMD and tibial bone microarchitecture. \nBody fat percentage was negatively associated with tibial cortical area, suggesting \nhigher body fat may be detrimental on bone. These results indicate associations \nbetween BMI, body fat percentage and bone health in older adults with obesity are \ndivergent, and that positive associations between BMI and bone health may be \nexplained by higher muscle mass and/or muscular power. \n Obesity defined by BMI is positively associated with bone mass and is \nprotective on bone health and fractures (5, 6, 10). In the current study, BMI was \npositively associated with total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine aBMD and tibial \ntrabecular vBMD, thickness, number, and bone volume fraction. In addition, as evident \nfrom the sensitivity analysis and mediation analysis, stair climb power test mediated \nthe associations between BMI on the trabecular bone microarchitecture. Similarly, a \n\n \nstudy of 200 community-dwelling adults aged 25 to 75 years demonstrated that those \nwith obesity defined by BMI had favourable bone microarchitecture and greater bone \nstrength at the distal radius and tibia compared to individuals without obesity (11). This \nis likely because of increased mechanical loading on bone from additional body weight \n(11, 33-36). In the above study, those with high BMI also had greater cortical thickness \nand vBMD estimated by the HR -pQCT, however, in the current study , BMI was not \nassociated with any cortical bone variables (11). This finding could be explained by \ndifferent population groups or differences in physical activity levels but further research \nis required to confirm associations of BMI with cortical bone parameters in older adults \nwith and without obesity. \n Body fat percentage , unlike BMI , is not protective on aBMD or bone \nmicroarchitecture (37). Many studies have previously investigated the associations \nbetween body fat percentage and bone health but were however limited to two -\ndimensional measures of aBMD assessed by DXA (38-41). No studies have \npreviously investigated the effects of obesity defined by body fat percentage on bone \nstructural parameters including cortical and trabecular bone microarchitecture using \nthree-dimensional imaging modalities such as HR -pQCT among older adults. In the \ncurrent study, body fat percentage was negatively associated with poorer tibial cortical \narea. In a study of 115 adolescent women, body fat percentage was inversely \nassociated with cortical bone area and cortical bone mineral content (BMC) at the tibia \nmeasured by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) (42). It seems that \nhigher body fat percentage is associated with bone microarchitecture degradation , \nwith cortical bone being more affected than trabecular bo ne (42, 43). An explanation \nfor this finding could be that individuals with higher fat mass may be more likely to \nhave hormonal imbalance which may cause excess bone resorption and poor bone \n\n \nhealth (37). In addition , it is also possible that excess adipose tissue leads to an \nincrease in bone marrow adipose tissue which may offset potential benefit s of \nmechanical loading on bone growth (33, 42, 44). This was evident in a study of 35 \nmen with obesity with a mean age of 34 years which reported excess bone marrow fat \nwas negatively associated with bone microarchitecture estimated by the HR -pQCT \n(45). Excess adiposity may also lead to systemic inflammation promoting the activity \nof cytokines and adipokines and subsequently inducing bone loss (46, 47). However, \nthe underlying mechanism s contributing to the associations between body fat \npercentage and cortical, rather than trabecular, bone microarchitecture among older \nadults with obesity warrants further investigation. \nMuscle mass is a strong determinant of bone health among older adults (11, \n48-51). In the current study, similar to BMI, ALM/height2 was positively associated with \naBMD at all sites and bone microarchitectural parameters including trabecular bone \nvolume fraction and trabecular thickness at the distal tibia. Similarly, in a study of 50 \nindividuals with obesity defined by BMI and metabolic syndrome aged under 50 years, \ntotal body lean mass was positively correlated with aBMD at the total femur and bone \nmicroarchitecture including trabecular bone volume fraction, trabecular number, \ntrabecular thickness and cortical thickness at the distal radius and tibia measured by \nHR-pQCT (48). Additionally, in a prospective study including 821 men aged 60 years \nand older, low appendicular lean mass was associated with an age-related decline in \nHR-pQCT determined bone microarchitecture (50). A plausible explanation for this is \nthat higher amounts of lean mass induce greater mechanical forces on adjacent bone \nduring locomotion, which stimulates improvements in bone density and \nmicroarchitecture (49, 51-54). Future studies should therefore develop interventions \n\n \ntargeting improv ements in lean mass and muscle function to prevent bone \nmicroarchitecture deterioration among older adults with obesity (55). \n Muscle strength has been found to be positively associated with bone health \n(56, 57). Likewise, in the current study , handgrip strength was associated with tibial \ncross-sectional area after adjusting for confounders. The lack of associations between \nhand grip strength and other bone parameters assessed in this study could be due to \nthe fact that bone microarchitecture in this study was assessed at the distal tibial site \nonly. In support, a study including 508 men and 651 women with the mean age of 70 \nyears showed that grip strength was positively associated with radial cross -sectional \narea measured by HR -pQCT (58). In addition, SPPB score was also positively \nassociated with tibial cortical porosity and was the only sarcopenia component \nassociated with bone failure load and bone stiffness after adjusting for confounders. \nIn this study, higher SPPB score was associated with better bone strength which may \ntherefore be protective against fractures. However, in our previous study including 50 \ncommunity-dwelling postmenopausal women aged between 49 to 82 years, SPPB \nscore was not associated with any of the bone strength estimates (22). These \ndifferences may be explained due to the fact that the current study includes individuals \nwith obesity unlike the abovementioned study which includes individuals with normal \nBMI. Examination of SPPB may therefore be a more important tool for screening \nindividuals with poor bone health and may have a utility in predicting fractures among \nolder adults with obesity compared to those without. In the current study , gait speed \nwas however not associated with any of bone variables. Our findings are similar to a \nstudy with 313 older men and 31 8 women with the mean age of 69.2 and 69.5 years \nrespectively, which also found no apparent relationship between gait speed \n(measured over a 3 metre distance) and bone microarchitecture assessed by pQCT \n\n \n(59). However, another study with 129 older adults with the mean age of 76.2 years \nfound that gait speed was positively associated with cortical BMD measured by pQCT \n(52). These contradictory findings may be explained by the use of maximum walking \nspeed in the above study and may be more closely associated with muscle power than \nusual gait speed which was used in the current study (52). \nIndeed, higher muscle power (assessed using a stair climb power test) in this \nstudy was strongly associated with better cortical bone area and bone stiffness among \nolder adults with obesity . Previously, no studies have investigate d the associations \nbetween muscle power and bone microarchitecture in older adults with obesity but in \nour previous study of 50 postmenopausal women, muscle power assessed by the stair \nclimb power test was consistently associated with HR-pQCT bone variables measured \nat the distal tibia (22). Similarly, in another study including 1,171 men aged 65 years \nand over, men with the highest leg power a ssessed by Nottingham Power Rig had \nlarger total bone area and cortical area compared with men who had the lowest leg \npower (60). A possible explanation for this finding could be that muscle power from \nincreased physiological mechanical loading may lead to changes in morphology of the \nbone, particularly the cortical bone contributing to better overall bone \nmicroarchitecture (60-62). Examination of muscle power may therefore be a useful \ntool in clinical practice for screening individuals at increased risk of poor bone health \namong older adults with obesity. \nThis study provides important insight s into associations between obesity, \nsarcopenia, and bone microarchitecture in older adults . There are however some \nlimitations. Firstly, this was a cross-sectional analysis from three studies with a \nrelatively small sample size and due to insufficient power, we may have had limited \nour ability to detect some associations, so our analyses could not be stratified based \n\n \non age groups or sex. Hence, longitudinal studies should be conducted in larger \npopulations to identify any sex -specific associations as recent evidence has \ndemonstrated that there are likely differences in bone size, BV/TV and trabecular \nthickness among men and women (63). Furthermore, the cross-sectional design limits \ninferences of causation in the associations of sarcopenia and obesity with bone health. \nIt should also be noted that genetics, nutrition status and hormonal factors not \nevaluated in this study, could have influenced the associations between components \nof obesity and sarcopenia on bone health. In regards to hormonal factors, it is not clear \nhow menopause status may have affected associations for women however given the \nminimum age for inclusion in the study was 55 years it is expected that most women \nwould have been postmenopausal . In addition, t he associations between TBS and \nbone parameters were only investigated in a sub-group of older adults with obesity in \nthis study (n=48) due to recommendations that TBS data should not be performed in \nindividuals with BMI ≥37kg/m2 (25). Future studies exploring associations of body \ncomposition with lumbar spine microarchitecture in individuals with obesity should \nconsider the use of computed tomography (CT) imaging. In addition, it should also be \nnoted that this study did not distinguish between android and gynoid obesity \nphenotypes which may have differing associations with overall bone health and bone \nmicroarchitecture. It should also be noted that individuals included in this study had \nobesity but otherwise were healthy community -dwelling older adults which may have \nexplained the low prevalence of sarcopenia. Furthermore, since there is no consensus \ndefinition for sarcopenia, the current study used both the S DOC and EWGSOP2 \ndefinitions and the use of different sarcopenia definitions could influence its observed \nprevalence and associations with bone health. \n\n \nIn conclusion, higher BMI, ALM and muscle power were associated with more \nfavourable bone microarchitecture, but high er body fat percentage was negatively \nassociated with cortical bone area, among older adults with obesity. These findings \nsuggest that h igh BMI is protective for aBMD and bone microarchitecture, which is \nexplained by higher muscle forces, but higher relative body fat is not associated \nwith/beneficial for bone health. Further longitudinal studies are required to understand \nthe underlying mechanisms contributing to poor bone microarchitecture among older \nadults with sarcopenia and obesity. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nStatements and Decelerations \nFunding \nThis work was supported by a 2018 Rebecca L.

The first \nchapter reviewed the literature and explored how risk factors including socioeconomic \nstatus, diet, physical activity, ethnicity, and sex may contribute to the prevalence of \nobesity, sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity (92, 209) . The review highlighted that \nthere is a paucity of research on how socioeconomic status is associated with \nsarcopenic obesity in older adults. This review also identified potential causes of \nadverse musculoskeletal health outcomes among older adults with sarcopenic \nobesity. Age -related alterations including changes in hormones, inflammation, and \nphysical activity levels may contribute either directly or ind irectly to the development \nof increased adiposity and declines in muscl e and bone mass and quality. However, \nthere is limited evidence on the relationship between sarcopenic obesity and \nmusculoskeletal outcomes, and whether factors such as sex and ethnicit y influence \nthese associations among older adults. \nChapter 2 presents the first study to determine associations between \nsocioeconomic status and sarcopenic obesity in a population of community -dwelling \nAustralian older adults. This study also investigated if physical activity levels mediated \nthe associations between socioeconomic determinants and components of sarcopenia \nand obesity. Lower educational attainment was associated with higher likelihood for \nobesity and sarcopenic obesity. Higher literacy levels promote healthier lifestyle \nchoices and may also enable higher purchasing power as a result of increased \ncapacity for earning higher incomes, which may support healthy eating (324, 325). \nIndeed, occupation and income are crucial determinant s of socioeconomic status , \nwhich contribute to the overall health of an individual (156, 326). In this study however \n\n 153 \nthere were no associations between occupation type and the risk of obesity, \nsarcopenia, or sarcopenic obesity. It is possible that the occupational classifications \nutilised in this study may be too broad to capture the wide range of socioeconomic \ndisparities that may exist within these classifications , and the use of income levels \nmay be more directly connected with obesity, sarcopenia, and sarcopenic obesity in \nolder adults. In deed, disadvantaged area of residence was associated with higher \nlikelihood for obesity in this study and this may more accurately reflect income \ncompared with broad occupation categories. Individuals residing in advantaged areas \nhave greater general literacy levels , which may allow them to make better health -\nrelated decisions, and also have better access to facilities such as gyms and health \ncare services, compared with individuals residing in disadvantaged areas (149, 327-\n329). Mediation analysis demonstrated that physical activity was a strong mediator of \nthe association between area of residence and obesity, implying that the benefit of \nliving in advantaged areas can be attributed to higher levels of physical activity. Public \nhealth messages for the prevention of obesity and sarcopenic obesity should be aimed \nat changing physical activity behaviour particularly among individuals with \ndisadvantaged socioeconomic status. There are several barriers to physical activity \nthat individuals with disadvantaged socioeconomic status often face, some of wh ich \ninclude lack of motivation, time, and support (330, 331) . These barriers may be \naddressed by developing methods for implementing workplace physical activity or by \nencouraging group -based exercises. In addition, it is important to develop focus \ngroups where these individuals have an opportunity to propose suitable activities \nwhich are both time efficient and can increase motivation for physical activity (332). \nThese interventions may increase motivation , social interactions and encourage \nengagement in more moderate-to-vigorous activity, which may prevent and reduce \n\n 154 \nobesity and sarcopen ia, and their effects on musculoskeletal health, among older \nadults with disadvantaged socioeconomic status (331). \nIn Chapter 2, both socioeconomic status and physical activity increased the \nprevalence of obesity among older adults . With increasing prevalence of obesity , \nChapter 3 therefore determined risk factors and underlying mechanisms contributing \nto incident fractures among older adults with obesity defined by both BMI and body fat \npercentage. The key finding from this study was evidence that the generally well-\naccepted apparent protective effect of obesity for aBMD and fractures appears to be \na direct result of the preferential use of BMI to define obesity. Although there is \nevidence that individuals with BMI-defined obesity are more prone to fractures at \nspecific sites compared to individuals without obesity, elevated aBMD and increased \nsoft tissue padding in obesity have contributed to a misconception that older adults \nwith obesity are protected from fractures (263, 333-335). In this study, obesity defined \nby body fat percentage was associated with increased likelihood of incident fractures \nwhereas, obesity defined by BMI was associated with reduced likelihood of incident \nfractures and this appeared to be explained by higher aBMD in those with higher BMI. \nDespite the fact that several risk factors were investigated in this study, including \nnumber of comorbidities, hand grip strength, leg strength and aBMD, falls risk score \n(standardised z -scores calculated based on performance in five physiological \ndomains) was the only consistent predictor of incident fractures among those with \nobesity defined by both BMI and body fat percentage (298). This data suggest that \nassessments of falls risk score could be useful in identifying underlying risk factor for \nfalls and predicting fractures in older adults with obesity, particularly given that aBMD \nis generally likely to be normal in this population . Although falls risk score is a valid \npredictor of incident falls, it may misclassify certain individuals as opposed to \n\n 155 \nassessing incident falls as an outcome (336). In addition, specialised equipment’s are \nrequired to assess falls risk score which may not be readily available in all clinical \nsettings (336). However, measuring incident falls generally requires large sample \nsizes with long follow-up periods in order to have sufficient statistical power. \nNo systematic review and meta -analysis has previously investigated the \nassociations of sarcop enic obesity with musculoskeletal outcomes including aBMD, \nfalls risk and fracture rates . Since obesity defined by body fat percentage was found \nto have detrimental effects on fractures in the previous chapter (Chapter 3) and \nsarcopenia itself is associated with poor bone health, falls and fractures, it is important \nto investigate whether sarcopenic obesity confers increased risk of thes e outcomes \ncompared with either condition alone , especially given the expected rise in the \nprevalence of sarcopenic obesity among older adults (337). Individuals with \nsarcopenic obesity had an increased risk of falls (expressed as falls incidence) and \nlower aBMD at the femoral neck compared to individuals with obesity alone and \ncontrols without sarcopenia or obesity. Although older adults with sarcopenic obesity \nhad higher aBMD at the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine, they also had a \nhigher risk of incident non -vertebral fractures compared with individuals with \nsarcopenia based on a meta-analysis of only two studies. Both the studies included in \nthis analysis defined obesity by body fat percentage and it is plausible that the \nclassification of obesity in these two studies contributed to the higher observed risk of \nfractures. It is also possible that there are differences in bone microarchitecture, which \ncould explain higher fracture risk despite greater aBMD among older adults with \nsarcopenic obesity compared with sarcopenia alone. The findings from this study have \nimportant impli cations for monitoring bone health and falls to prevent the risk of \nfractures among individuals with sarcopenic obesity. However, most of the studies in \n\n 156 \nthis systematic review and meta -analysis were limited to Caucasian populations and \nadditional studies are required in diverse populations. \nThus, in Chapter 5, we explored the sex-specific prevalence of sarcopenic \nobesity and its associations with bone density in a population of Indian older adults. \nSarcopenic obesity was more prevalent in men than women, and there were sex -\nspecific associations with bone health. Men with sarcopenic obesity had worse aBMD, \nbut both men and women with sarcopenia had lower aBMD, compared with controls \nwithout sarcopenia or obesity. However, women, but not men, with obesity exhibited \nbetter aBMD compared with controls. Differences in fat distribution, sex hormones, the \nage of onset of muscle degeneration , genetics , physical activity, and bone \nmicroarchitecture in this ethnic population of older adults may contribute to these sex-\nspecific relationships (322, 323, 338 -340). This study was however limited to two-\ndimensional measures of bone health assessed by DXA, and the use of three-\ndimensional imaging modalities such as HR-pQCT may capture effects of sarcopenia \nand obesity on bone structural parameters including cortical and trabecular bone \nmicroarchitecture which cannot be determined by DXA. \nChapter 6 therefore involved an investigation of the associations of components \nof obesity (BMI and body fat p ercentage) and sarcopenia (muscle mass and muscle \nstrength/power) with bone health assessed by both DXA and HR-pQCT in older adults \nwith obesity. Obesity and sarcopenia components including BMI, ALM and stair climb \npower were associated with higher DXA -determined aBMD and bone \nmicroarchitecture assessed by HR -pQCT. Sensitivity analysis confirmed that h igher \nlean mass may contribute to the positive associations between BMI and bone health \n(341). There were no associations bet ween hand grip strength and bone \nmicroarchitecture, which could be explained by the fact that bone microarchitecture \n\n 157 \nwas only assessed at the tibia in this study. However, higher muscle power (assessed \nby stair climb power test ) was positively associated w ith cortical area and bone \nstiffness suggesting that muscle power may be a better indicator of bone \nmicroarchitecture in older adults with obesity compared with muscle strength. \nConversely, body fat percentage was found to be adversely associated with cortical \nthickness, suggesting that higher body fat in older adults with obesity may have \ndeleterious effects on bone microarchitecture, particular ly in the cortical \ncompartments, and highlights that higher relative body fat is not associated \nwith/beneficial for bone health in older adults. \nIn summary, t his line of research demonstrates that socioeconomic status \ncontributes to sarcopenic obesity in older adults and that musculoskeletal \nconsequences associated with this condition include po or aBMD and a greater falls \nand fracture risk, which may be influenced by sex and ethnicity. More comprehensive \nmusculoskeletal assessments for predicti ng falls and fractures in older adults with \nsarcopenic obesity are required in diverse populations . Body composition \nassessments by DXA, and bone microarchitecture assessments evaluated by HR-\npQCT, may be useful in older adults with obesity, as associations of body fat rather \nthan BMI appear to best represent the true relationship of obesity with bone health, \nand bone microarchitecture measurements may be less likely than aBMD to be \ninfluenced positively by greater body size. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 158 \nLimitations \n There are some limitations to the research presented within this thesis. All \noriginal research chapters (Chapter 2, 3, 5, 6) utilised cross -sectional data in this \nthesis, and in order to identify causative effects of socioeconomic status on sarcopenic \nobesity, and of sarcopenic obesity on musculoskeletal health outcomes, longitudinal \nstudies with larger sample sizes are required. In Chapter 2, due to the low numbers, it \nwas not possible to evaluate the sex-specific associations between socioeconomic \nstatus and sarcopenic obesity. Studies have shown that there are sex -specific \nassociations between socioeconomic status and obesity and it is vital to understand if \nsimilar associations persist among those with sarcopenic obesity for the development \nof appropriate interventions relevant to both men and women (342, 343). This study \nalso collected data between 2002 and 2004 and these associations may not be \nrepresentative of the socioeconomic status and body composition profiles of current \npopulations of Australian older adults. Sarcopenia was defined using the lowest 20 th \npercentile of the sex-specific ALM/height (m 2) and hand grip strength, and therefore \nmay not be comparable with other studies using different definitions of sarcopenia. \nSimilarly, in Chapter 2, 3 and 5, body fat percentage cut -points based on previous \nrecommendations were utilised since there is no consensus definition of obesity by \nbody fat percentage (344). Therefore, it is important to note that t he use of different \ncut-points might influence the associations with incident fractures. In the meta-analysis \nin Chapter 4, due to low number of studies, it was not possible to perform sub-analyses \nbased on age, sex, ethnicity, definitions of obesity and sarcopenia , which could have \nexplained the high heterogeneity observed for some of the analyses. Only two studies \nwere included for the meta-analysis of associations of incident fractures. Additionally, \nChapter 3 and 5 were both limited to DXA to assess bone health. The use of three-\n\n 159 \ndimensional imaging technology such as HR-pQCT to assess bone microarchitecture \nmay provide better insights into the relationship between sarcopenic obesity and bone \nhealth in diverse populations. Additionally, since there is no consensus definition for \nsarcopenia, this study utilised the AWGS definition as it is the recommended \ndiagnostic criteria in Asian populations, and the use of this definition may have \ninfluenced the observed associations with bone health. Furthermore, in this study all \nindividuals resided in Hyderabad, India. Given diversity in lifestyle and environmental \nfactors across geographical locations, these findings can not be generalised to other \nregions of India. Finally, Chapter 6 was a cross-sectional analysis from three studies, \nwhich consisted of a relatively small sample size. It is possible that lack of statistical \npower influenced our results. In addition, bone microarchitecture was only assessed \nat the tibial site in this study, and future studies should assess associations of \nsarcopenia and obesity components with bone microarchitecture at other skeletal \nsites. Considering fractures at the radius are the most co mmon types of fall -related \nfractures of the upper extremities in older adults with obesity, it is important to assess \nassociations of components of sarcopenic obesity with bone microarchitecture at this \nskeletal site (345). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 160 \nFuture directions \n In light of the novel findings and limitations described above, this thesis has \nraised several new research questions which require further investigation. \n This research program has demonstrated that higher BMI has a protective \neffect on bone health as obesity defined by BMI was associated with reduced \nlikelihood of incident fractures (Chapter 3) and BMI was positively associated with \naBMD and bone microarchitecture in older adults with obesity (Chapter 6). \nConversely, body fat percentage was associated with increased likelihood of incident \nfractures (Chapter 3) and negatively associated with aBMD and bone \nmicroarchitecture particularly at the cortical compartments (Chapter 6) . Further \nresearch is required to corroborate these findings in various ethnic populations and to \ndetermine sex-specific and ethnic-specific cut-points to identify individuals with poor \nbody composition who are at a greater risk of poor musculoskeletal outcomes. \nAmong older adults with obesity, m uscle power was associated with more \nfavourable bone microarchitecture (Chapter 6), suggesting this measurement , along \nwith falls risk score (Chapter 3) may be useful in fracture risk assessments. This may \nbe particularly true when only DXA estimates of aBMD, which are likely to be elevated \nin older adults with obesity , and not three -dimensional bone microarchitecture \nassessments, are available clinically to assess bon e health . In addition, t here are \nseveral pathophysiological and biological manifestations including lifestyle \nbehaviours, hormones, and immunological factors that occur in sarcopenia and \nobesity which can adversely affect musculoskeletal health, and subsequently increase \nfalls and fracture risk (79, 346). It is therefore important to evaluate if other risk factors \nnot measured in Chapter 3 and Chapter 6 could have utility in predicting fractures and \nadverse musculoskeletal health in older adults with obesity and sarcopenia . Future \n\n 161 \nresearch should investigate whether clinical factors such as physical activity , \nfunctional measures (e.g. timed up and go test), and bone microarchitecture can help \nidentify important risk factors for fractures in this at -risk population of older adults \n(347). \nSex-specific differences in prevalence of obesity, sarcopenia and sarcopenic \nobesity, and their associations with bone health, were observed in Indian older adults \n(Chapter 5). With the expected increase in the ageing of population in India, the \nprevalence of sarcopenic obesity is expected to increase. There is a paucity of \nresearch on how body composition contributes to poor bone health. Investigating this \nin larger cohorts will help determine risk factors associated with falls and fracture s \namong Indian older adults. Furthermore, development of various culturally -relevant \ninterventions is necessary to reduce prevalence of sarcopenic obesity in diverse \npopulations. Dietary patterns illustrat e lifestyle differences that exist across India \nbecause they are influenced by a variety of religious, cultural and family values, with \ncertain populations forbidden to consume diets containing meat (348). As a result, the \nsame intervention for improving muscle mass and function, and reducing fat mass, \ncannot be delivered to different demographic groups. Future studies should \ninvestigate the long -term effects of different diets and exercise modalities and \nintensities on musculoskeletal parameters during diet -induced weight loss in older \nadults with sarcopenic obesity from diverse populations. In addition, assessing body \ncomposition in these individuals is vital as lean mass and body fat are better predictors \nof health outcomes than BMI (349). However, in a low to middle income country like \nIndia, DXA may not be readily accessible. In such resource limiting setting s, health \nprofessionals may utilise bioimpedance analysis (BIA) as a surrogate measure of body \ncomposition as it is a relatively low-cost machine compared to DXA (350). In addition, \n\n 162 \nresults of the current study may be influenced by the inclusion of the lower age range \nas this study included individuals aged 50 years and over. Future studies should \nevaluate these associations in older age groups . Additionally, s ince there is no \nconsensus definition for sarcopenia, in Chapter 5, the AWGS definition was utilised \namong an Indian community of older adults . However, this definition was largely \ndefined based on data from Southeast Asian countries. Developing population-specific \ncut-points might produce alterna tive and therefore potentially more reflective result s. \nThe use of the South Asian Working Action Group on SARCOpenia (SWAG-SARCO) \nconsensus definition may accurately class individuals as having sarcopenia and \nsarcopenic obesity in South Asian populations, which may enhance the understanding \nof these conditions in ethnic populations (351). \nSeveral original research chapters in this thesis (Chapter 3, 4 and 5) were \nlimited to two -dimensional measures of bone health assessed by DXA . Given the \nlimitations of DXA highlighted above, additional studies using assessments of bone \nmicroarchitecture (e.g. HR-pQCT) are required. Similar methodological approaches in \nlarger prospective cohort studies with three -dimensional musculoskeletal \nassessments are warranted. This will increase understanding of the impact of \nsarcopenic obesity on bone parameters other than aBMD. Although Chapter 6 \ninvestigated the effects of components of obesity and sarcopenia on bone \nmicroarchitecture, it was limited to the assessment of bone microarchitecture at the \ntibial site and future studies should determine bone variables at the radial site as well \nas sites associated with major osteoporotic fracture burden including the hip and \nspine. \n In Chapter 4, it was identified that older adults with sarcopenic obesity have \npoorer aBMD, and increased risk for falls compared with individuals with obesity alone \n\n 163 \nand controls without obesity or sarcopenia but had a higher risk of fractures compared \nto individuals with sarcopenia alone. It is critical to develop interventions targeting \nreductions in fat mass with improvements in muscle mass and muscle \nstrength/function to reduce the burden of this condition and its consequences for \nhealth care and disability -related services. Recent evidence has demonstrated that \nweight loss improves metabolic health among individuals with obesity, but also results \nin bone and muscle loss (312, 352, 353) . Studies on exercise intervention s in older \nadults have demonstrated that resistance programs such as high-intensity resistance \nand impact training (HiRIT) may be an effective strategy for preventing bone loss, but \nits effects on individuals with sarcopenic obesity undergoing weight loss are poorly \nunderstood (354-356). I am currently working on a pilot study at Monash University \n(Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registration Number: \nACTRN12618001146280) that addresses this unmet need. Th is study is a 12 -week \nrandomised controlled trial of older adults with sarcopenic obesity undergoing a dietary \nweight loss intervention and undertaking either supervised HiRIT or home -based \naerobic exercise. If demonstrated to be feasible and effective for improving physical \nfunction in this pilot study, it will provide rationale for larger trials to determine whether \nHiRIT prevents muscle and bone mass losses during weight loss in older adults with \nsarcopenic obesity. The abovementioned pilot study also utilises three -dimensional \nmeasures of bone outcomes assessed by the HR -pQCT, which may provide further \ninsights into the effects of an exercise and diet -induced weight loss intervention for \nimprovements in musculoskeletal outcomes among older adults with sarcopenic \nobesity. In light of current lifestyles and overall convenience for older adults as a result \nof Covid-19 pandemic, it may be beneficial for future trials to also develop interventions \nin different settings, such as developing home -based high -intensity resistance and \n\n 164 \nimpact exercise along with caloric restriction supported by digital health tools such as \nsmartphone apps. \n Chapter 2 provided evidence that lower socioeconomic status is associated \nwith sarcopenic obesity. Given data was collected between 2002 and 2004 in this \nstudy, with likely shifts in socioeconomic status profiles it is important to understand \nthese effects in a contemporary population of older adults (357). A large prospective \ncohort study explori ng sex-specific associations between socioeconomic status, \nphysical activity and sarcopenic obesity is therefore required. Given physical activity \nmediated the associations between socioeconomic status and obesity, future studies \ndeveloping interventions for the preventi on of obesity and sarcopenic obesity among \nolder adults should include physical activity programs specifically designed for \ndisadvantaged socioeconomic status groups. Individuals who are socioeconomically \nchallenged may need access to different modes of physical activity along with regular \nmonitoring with focused support (331, 358). Physical activity should be promoted by \neducating individuals facing socioeconomic challenges about the advantages of \nparticipating in regular physical activity including improved social connections, social \ninclusion, active mobility, employability, and productivity (331). According to a recent \nreview, these individuals should also be advised to participate in m ulti-component, \nintensive group -based exercise intervention s to have maximal benefits (331). \nFurthermore, this group of individuals may benefit from weight loss interventions in \naddition to physical activity as this may provide additional benefits in terms of \nincreased physical function and independence (359). Further research should assess \nthe long -term benefits of such interventions in older adults with disadvantaged \nsocioeconomic status in diverse populations. \n \n\n 165 \nConclusion \nIn summary, this body of work has highlighted risk factors contributing to \nsarcopenic obesity among older adults , and the musculoskeletal consequences \nassociated with it. High BMI has a protective effect on aBMD, bone microarchitecture \nand incident fractures among older adults with obesity, but body fat percentage \nprovides no such advantage and in fact has a detrimental impact on bone health. Body \nfat percentage may therefore be a more useful screening method for clinicians to \nidentify individuals with obesity who are at increased risk of poor musculoskeletal \nhealth. In addition, a ssessments of muscle power and falls risk may help predict \nfractures among older adults with obesity. Individuals with the comorbid sarcopenic \nobesity are at increased risk of falls compared with obesity and controls and also have \nhigher aBMD but increased fracture rates compared with individuals with sarcopenia. \nComprehensive assessment of musculoskeletal health in this vulnerable group of \nolder adults may therefore provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms \ncontributing to this increased risk of adverse musculoskeletal outcomes as opposed \nto traditional measures of two-dimensional aBMD. Sex and ethnicity may also further \ninfluence the relationship between sarcopenic obesity and bone health . Sarcopenic \nobesity therefore warrants increased scientific, public, and clinical attention in diverse \npopulations of older adults. The findings from this thesis may be of importance in \ndirecting future intervention studies developing population -specific prevention and \nmanagement strategies to target prolonged independence in older adults with \nsarcopenic obes ity. Future studies should focus on characterising , and providing \nguidelines for the identification and management of, poor musculoskeletal outcomes \nin diverse populations of older adults with sarcopenic obesity. Implementation of these \n\n 166 \noutcomes will support healthy ageing and improve the overall quality of lives of these \nindividuals. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 167 \nReferences \n1.

We determined associations of objective measures of 19 \nphysical function and HRQoL with bone health in postmenopausal women with low areal bone 20 \nmineral density (aBMD). Fifty postmenopausal women (64.4  7.7 years old; mean  standard 21 \ndeviation) with low spine, hip or femo ral neck aBMD (T - or Z-score <-1.0) on dual -energy X-ray 22 \nabsorptiometry (DXA) participated. Femoral surface BMD, trabecular, integral and cortical 23 \nvolumetric BMD (vBMD) measurements were obtained using 3D-SHAPER software on DXA. Distal 24 \ntibial vBMD and micr oarchitecture were assessed using high -resolution peripheral quantitative 25 \ncomputed tomography (HRpQCT). Participants completed self-administered EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) 26 \nand modified falls efficacy scale (MFES) questionnaires , and physical function assessments. Stair 27 \nclimb power was positively associated with bone parameters at the hip, femoral neck and distal 28 \ntibia (all p<0.05) in multivariable linear regression. EQ-5D demonstrated no significant associations 29 \nwith bone parameters and MFES was positively associated only with distal tibial cortical vBMD and 30 \ncortical von Mises stress (both p<0.05). Objective measures of physical function, particularly muscle 31 \npower, are more consistently associated with bone parameters compared with self-administered 32 \nHRQoL questionnaires. 33 \nKeywords: osteoporosis; postmenopausal women; physical function; bone; health -related quality 34 \nof life 35 \n1. Introduction 36 \nOsteoporosis is an age -associated disease largely affecting postmenopausal women due to a 37 \nsteep decline in oestrogen levels following menopause [1,2]. Osteoporosis is defined as low bone 38 \nmineral density (BMD) and bone microarchitecture increasing bone fragility and the risk of fracture 39 \n[3,4]. The current clinical gold standard for diagnosing osteoporosis is a du al-energy X-ray 40 \nabsorptiometry (DXA) scan which measures areal BMD (aBMD) [1,5]. Although DXA has many 41 \nadvantages, there are a number of limitations such as space restrictions in a clinical setting and 42 \nequipment expenses. Hence, the development of cost-effective but reliable methods for identifying 43 \n\nJ. Clin. Med. 2019, 8, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 14 \n \nindividuals at increased risk for poor bone health are important in reducing the burden of 44 \nosteoporosis. 45 \nAge-related declines in physical function, particularly in postmenopausal women, are 46 \nsequentially associated with loss of bone and bone mass [6]. Declining physical activity levels with 47 \nage contribute to bone fragility and an increasing fracture risk in older adults [6, 7]. Individuals with 48 \nbetter physical function are more capable of engaging in physical activity, which has a protective 49 \neffect on bone health through mechanical loading [ 8]. Physical performance assessments can easily 50 \nbe incorporated into a clinical environment given they are generally feasible and have been 51 \nrecommended for risk assessment and diagnosis for a range of conditions including sarcopenia [8,9]. 52 \nIt is possible that they may also have utility for prediction of bone loss in older adults and may be 53 \nuseful for clinicians to identify individuals at risk of poor bone health [9,10]. 54 \nHealth-related quality of life ( HRQoL) comprises aspects of physical, emotional and mental -55 \nwellbeing which are known to decrease with age [11]. HRQoL instruments are useful and inexpensive 56 \nassessment tools for overall health status [ 11, 12]. While osteoporosis negatively effects HRQoL in 57 \nolder adults, it is also possible that declines in HRQoL contribute to reductions in bone health , in a 58 \nbidirectional manner. Fear of falling may also be associated with HRQoL and increases with age 59 \nresulting in lack of confidence in performing daily tasks, particularly in older women [12]. Both poor 60 \nHRQoL and fear of falling may therefore be associated with bone health in older adults and could be 61 \nclinically relevant self-reported measures to identify individuals at increased risk of osteoporosis [13]. 62 \nThe aim of the present study was to determine the associations between self-reported HRQoL, 63 \nfear of falling, and objective measures of physical function with BMD and bone microarchitecture in 64 \npostmenopausal women with low aBMD. 65 \n2. Methods 66 \n2.1. Study design and participants 67 \nThis analysis utilised baseline data from an exercise intervention conducted at the Monash 68 \nHealth Translation Precinct in Melbourne, Australia. Fifty community -dwelling postmenopausal 69 \nwomen residing in Melbourne, Australia were recruited for this study. Recruitment of participants 70 \nwas achieved through advertisements in the local community, hospitals, businesses, and clubs . 71 \nInclusion criteria included: T- or Z-score at spine, hip or femoral neck -1.0; body mass index (BMI) 72 \n< 30kg/m 2; <150 minutes of self -reported moderate to vigorous physical ac tivity per week ; and 73 \nEnglish-speaking. The study (ANZCTR number: ACTRN12618000101280) was approved by Monash 74 \nHealth Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/16/MonH/364) and all participants provided 75 \nwritten informed consent prior to completing any study assessments. 76 \n2.2. Questionnaires 77 \nAt baseline, participants completed self -administered questionnaires including questions on 78 \ndemographics, medication use, disease history, smoking status and physical activity. HRQoL was 79 \nmeasured using the EuroQol -5D (EQ -5D) [ 12]. The EQ-5D consists of five HRQoL dimensions; 80 \nmobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Participants selected one 81 \nof three responses for each of the dimensions based on which an EQ-5D score was derived to measure 82 \nthe HRQoL status. Scores of the EQ -5D questionnaire range from 1 to 3, where 1 indicates no 83 \nproblems, 2 indicates some problems and 3 indicates extreme problems/ unable to perform that 84 \nactivity from which a total EQ-5D score (range: 5-15; higher scores indicate poorer HRQoL) has been 85 \nderived. The modified falls efficacy scale (MFES) was used to assess fear of falls while completing 86 \ncertain tasks [14,15]. MFES consists of 14 questions related to a range of daily activities to determine 87 \nconfidence undertaking certain tasks (for example; get in/out of chair) [14]. Participants rated their 88 \nlevel of confidence for each of the activities on a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 meaning not confident/not 89 \nsure and 10 being completely confident/completely sure. Possible range of total scores in the MFES 90 \nquestionnaire were 0 to 140 (with higher scores indicating better confidence) [16]. 91 \n\nJ. Clin. Med. 2019, 8, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 14 \n \n2.3. Physical Function 92 \nObjective assessments of physical function were performed, including the stair climb power test 93 \n(SCPT) and the short physical performance battery (SPPB). The SCPT was performed to evaluate leg 94 \nmuscle power and mobility performance [1 7]. Participants began the test from the base of a 10 -stair 95 \nflight of stairs and were asked to climb the stairs as fast as possible, in a safe manner. The time taken 96 \nfor the participants to ascend the flight of stairs was recorded in seconds using a stopwatch. We then 97 \ncalculated stair climb power using the following formula: power = force X velocity [17]. Force was 98 \ncalculated as the product of participant body mass (kg) and acceleration due to gravity (9.8m/s 2). 99 \nVelocity was calculated from the vertical height of stairs (1.75 metres) divided by stair climb time 100 \n(seconds). The SPPB test consists of gait speed, chair stand and standing balance assessments and 101 \nprovides a composite SPPB score [18,19]. For the chair stand test, participants were required to stand 102 \nup straight from a seated position five times as quickly as possible and the time taken was recorded. 103 \nTo complete the gait speed test, participants were required to walk 2.44 metres at a comfortable and 104 \nnormal pace. Gait speed was calculated by distance (walking course 2.44 metres) and time taken to 105 \ncomplete the test (seconds). For the standing balance tests, the participants were required to hold two 106 \npositions: semi-tandem and full-tandem, for 10 seconds. The semi-tandem stand involves placing the 107 \npreferred foot in front of the other with the side of heel from the front foot touching the first toe of 108 \nthe other foot. The full-tandem stand is performed by placing the preferred foot in front of the other 109 \nand the back of the heel on the front foot touching the toes of the back foot. A total score out of 12 110 \n(higher scores indicate better physical function) was calculated based on the performance of the three 111 \ntests: chair stand, gait speed and standing balance assessments [18]. 112 \n2.4. Anthropometric, bone and blood biochemistry parameters 113 \nParticipants attended the clinic appointment following an overnight fast of  10 hours. A 20ml 114 \nblood sample was collected by a qualified phlebotomist, and serum samples were analysed for 25 -115 \nhydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) using the DiaSorin Liaison (DiaSorin Inc, Stillwater, MN, USA) 116 \n25(OH)D assay, a direct competitive chemiluminescent immunoassay. 117 \nHeight (m) and weight (kg) were measured with footwear, headwear and heavy items of 118 \nclothing removed. Height was measured using a portable stadiometer (Seca 213, Germany), weight 119 \nwas measured using an electronic scale (Seca 804, Germany) and body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) was 120 \ncalculated. 121 \nEach participant had a DXA scan (Hologic Discovery A, Hologic, USA), where aBMD and bone 122 \nmineral content (BMC) were assessed at the total hip, femoral neck and lumbar spine using Hologic 123 \nApex software version 5.6.0.2. Osteoporosis was classified as T-score  -2.5 and osteopenia as T-score 124 \nbetween -1 and -2.5, in line with guidelines from World Health Organisation [ 20]. Lumbar spine 125 \ntrabecular bone score (TBS) was assessed using TBS iNsight software version 3.0.2 (Medimaps, 126 \nSwitzerland). Using an algorithm, the 3D -SHAPER software (Galgo Medical, Barcelona, Spain) was 127 \napplied to two-dimensional DXA scans of the proximal femur to model the femoral shape and BMD 128 \ndistribution in three dimensions , and then derived estimates for trabecular, cortical and integral 129 \nvolumetric BMD (vBMD) and surface BMD, a measure of fracture resistance [21]. 130 \nHigh-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT) scans (XtremeCT II, 131 \nScanCo, Switzerland) were performed to determine the integral bone quality and strength at the 132 \ndistal tibia [22, 23]. Briefly, the non -dominant leg was placed in a cast and stabilized to prevent 133 \nmovement and subsequent artefacts. A scout scan was used to place t he reference line at the tibial 134 \nendplate. A subsequent scan of one hundred and sixty -eight parallel computed tomography slices , 135 \nencompassing a 9.02mm region of the distal tibia was performed with an isotropic resolution of 136 \n<55m. HRpQCT scans were then analysed using the manufacturer’s standard protocol, using 137 \nsoftware version 6.1. Trabecular and cortical bone parameters derived from HRpQCT included: 138 \ntrabecular cross-sectional area (mm2), trabecular thickness (mm) trabecular separation (mm; the mean 139 \nspace between the trabeculae), cortical cross-sectional area (mm), cortical vBMD, cortical porosity (%; 140 \nthe segmented pore volume ) and cortical periosteal perimeter (mm). [22,23]. Micro-finite element 141 \nanalysis was also performed to assess the effects of a simulated mechanical load to estimate trabecular 142 \n\nJ. Clin. Med. 2019, 8, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 14 \n \nand cortical von Mises stress (MPa), which is used for fracture prediction with lower values 143 \nindicating greater fracture resistance, as well as estimated bone failure load (N) and bone stiffness 144 \n(N/mm2) [24,25]. 145 \n2.5. Accelerometer-determined physical activity 146 \nEach participant was provided with an Actigraph GT3X -BT accelerometer (Actigraph, 147 \nPensacola, CA, USA ) and instructed to wear the accelerometer at the side of the hip for seven 148 \nconsecutive days except during showering, water activities and sleeping. A diary was also provided, 149 \nto record the time of the day that the device was worn and removed, time spent outdoors, physical 150 \nactivity performed and any issues that affected their physical activity estimates (for example, health 151 \nissues resulting in low physical activity). The accelerometer data was recorded at a rate of 50Hz and 152 \ntransferred into ActiLife v6.13.3 software for analysis. Accelerometer activity was transformed into 153 \ncounts per minute (CPMs) with an activity threshold of 100 CPMs. The ActiLife software analysed 154 \ndata in epoch lengths of 60 seconds. Physical activity was categorised based on the following 155 \nFreedson adult cut points of 1 to 99CPMs (sedetary), 100 to 1951 CPMs (light) and >1952 CPMs 156 \n(moderate to vigorous physical activity, MVPA) [26]. MVPA was combined into a single variable due 157 \nto the low amount of vigorous physical activity recorded in these postmenopausal women [27]. 158 \n2.6. Statistical Analysis 159 \nAll statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software version 25 (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA). 160 \nData related to HRQoL and physical function were non -normally distributed, and so Spearman’s 161 \ncorrelations were performed to determine associations for self -reported HRQoL (EQ-5D and MFES) 162 \nand objective measures of physical function ( SCPT, SPPB and its components, with the exception of 163 \nstanding balance) with bone parameters. Multivariable linear re gression analysis was performed to 164 \nfurther investigate these associations after adjusting for confounders including age, MVPA, BMI and 165 \n25(OH)D. For all analyses, p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. 166 \n3. Results 167 \nIn total, 50 postmenopau sal women were recruited with an age range of 49 -82 years (Table 1). 168 \nMean BMI was in the normal range with no current smokers in this population and the most common 169 \nself-reported comorbidities were hypertension and hypercholesterolemia . The majority (88%) of 170 \nparticipants had sufficient 25(OH)D levels ( 50nmol/L). Twenty -two (44%) participants had 171 \nosteoporosis and twenty -seven (54%) had osteopenia, based on DXA T-scores. One 49-year-old 172 \nparticipant had total hip and lumbar spine Z-scores of -1.5 and -0.9, respectively. No participants 173 \nindicated extreme problems or an inability to perform activity in any of the five domains of the EQ-174 \n5D questionnaire. Most participants (62%) had the maximum MFES score of 140, indicating general 175 \ngood health based on the self-reported HRQoL and fear or falling questionnaires. Participants spent 176 \nalmost three -quarters of their accelerometer wear time in sedentary behavior, and only 177 \napproximately 5% of their time performing moderate to vigorous intensity activity. Twenty-nine 178 \n(56%) participants had an SPPB score of 12/12 and participants had a range of 176-385W for the SCPT. 179 \nTable 1.

Discussion 239 \nOur cross-sectional study in community-dwelling postmenopausal women with low aBMD 240 \ndemonstrates that an objective measure of muscle power is more consistently associated with bone 241 \nparameters than other clinically-relevant objective measures of physical performance, self -reported 242 \nHRQoL, and fea r of falling. This is the first study to compare associations of self -administered 243 \nquestionnaires and objectively measured physical function with bone health using advanced bone 244 \nimaging. Our data suggest objective assessments, particularly the SCPT, may be used in screening 245 \nindividuals at risk of poor bone health in clinical settings. Given that physical assessments can be 246 \neasily incorporated in clinical settings, they may serve as useful screening tools to help address 247 \ncurrent underdiagnosis of osteoporosis [28]. 248 \nTotal EQ-5D scores had no associations with any bone parameters . In contrast, a prior study of 249 \n325 women with mean age of 60 years demonstrated that osteoporotic women have poorer HRQoL 250 \nas estimated by EQ -5D questionnaires , compared with healthy individuals of a similar age [2 9]. 251 \nAdditionally, a study including 222 participants with mean age of 79 years reported that those with 252 \nosteoporosis had poorer HRQoL even compared with those with osteopenia, although the HRQoL in 253 \nthis study was measur ed using the quality of life questionnaire of the International Osteoporosis 254 \nFoundation (QUALEFFO-41), which specific ally measures osteoporosis-related HRQoL [30]. While 255 \nwe did not compare the women with osteopenia or osteoporosis in this study to a control group with 256 \nnormal aBMD, t he lack of association between HRQoL and bone parameters in this population is 257 \npotentially explained by the overall good general health in the current study where the majority of 258 \nwomen had either no or few problems for each of the EQ-5D domains. Nonetheless, longitudinal 259 \nstudies with a larger sample size are required to determine whether poorer HRQoL is predictive of 260 \nan accelerated decline in bone health in older age. It is possible that an osteoporosis-specific HRQoL 261 \ninstrument may be more sensitive in detecting such a relationship. 262 \nDespite the lack of association for total EQ-5D scores, the mobility and pain/discomfort domains 263 \nof EQ-5D were associated with the bone parameters. A study of 1,000 Korean women aged ≥60 years 264 \nreported that individuals with osteoporosis had significantly higher scores in the mobility, 265 \npain/discomfort and usual activities domains of EQ-5D [31]. The lack of association of usual activities 266 \nHRQoL with bone health in the present study may relate to the fact that only a few women reported 267 \nsome difficulty with usual activities. It is possible that identification of women with reduced mobility 268 \nand increased pain/discomfort could be a useful strategy to determine an increased osteoporosis risk. 269 \nOur study is the first we are aware of to demonstrate an association between higher MFES scores 270 \n(indicating lower fear of falling) and better cortical bone health, including distal tibial cortical vBMD 271 \nand cortical von Mises stress. These associations were significant even after adjusting for 272 \nconfounders, including physical activity, in multivariable linear regression analyses suggesting that 273 \nother factors associated with fear of falling , perhaps including mobility and pain/discomfort, may 274 \ninfluence bone he alth in women with low aBMD. A study of 140 participants reported that fear of 275 \nfalling is increased in older adults with osteoporosis [32]. However, in the current study majority of 276 \n\nJ. Clin. Med. 2019, 8, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 14 \n \nthe women with low aBMD had the maximum overall score of 140 , indicating t he lowest fear of 277 \nfalling. As demonstrated by the objective measures of physical function, and the fact that these 278 \nwomen self -selected to participate in an exercise intervention, they likely represent a sample of 279 \npostmenopausal population with a relatively low falls risk. Furthermore, a lthough knowledge of 280 \nosteoporosis and awareness of a diagnosis increases fear of falls in older women [32], the majority of 281 \nwomen in the current study were osteopenic rather than osteoporotic, and therefore less susceptible 282 \nto fear of falling. Regardless, the association of fear of falling with cortical bone parameters warrants 283 \nfurther investigation. 284 \nPhysical function is potentially an important predictor of fracture risk, largely due to its 285 \nrelationship with falls [33]. Previous studies have also suggested that improved physical performance 286 \nis associated with better bone health. A study of 3,041 older adults reported that physical 287 \nperformance was moderately associated with hip BMD and we previously reported in over 3,300 288 \nSwedish older adults that better performance in the timed up-and-go test was associated with better 289 \ndistal tibial trabecular vBMD assessed by standard peripheral quantitative computed tomography 290 \n[34,35]. Surprisingly, chair stand time was not associated with any of the bone parameters in this 291 \nstudy, and gait speed was significantly negatively associated with trabecular thickness and trabecular 292 \nvon Mises stress at the distal tibia. A study of 116 postmenopausal women observed that gait speed 293 \nwas positively associated with hip aBMD, but similarly found no associations between chair rise time 294 \nand aBMD [36]. It is possible that gait speed has differing associations with bone compartments at 295 \ndifferent anatomical sites, given that the hip primarily comprises cortical rather than trabecular bone. 296 \nA study of 1,061 Japanese postmenopausal women reported that gait s peed can be used in 297 \ncombination with lower extremity strength measurements as screening tools for low aBMD in 298 \npostmenopausal women, but based on the findings of the present study, further research is required 299 \nto explore its associations with bone microarchitectural parameters and vBMD [9]. Previous research 300 \nhas also demonstrated that physical performance tests can improve the predictive ability of existing 301 \nfracture prediction tools, but the present study is the firs t we are aware of to indicate that a simpl e 302 \nassessment of muscle power, rather than physical performance per se, is more consistently associated 303 \nwith bone health. Thus, future prospective st udies should explore whether the addition of muscle 304 \npower assessment improves fracture prediction compared with other functional assessments [37]. 305 \nStimulation of bone formation through resistance exercise is necessary for the maintenance of 306 \nbone health due to the insufficient mechanical loading obtained from daily activities in older adults 307 \n[38]. Furthermore, high intensity resistance training has been shown to improve aBMD and enhance 308 \nphysical function in older women, and this exercise targeting muscle power may be superior to 309 \ntraditional resistance training for maximizing bone health in older age [39]. We observed that SCPT 310 \nwas positively associated with distal tibial trabecular area, as well as with femoral neck and total hip 311 \naBMD. Our findings therefore support the concept that improving muscle power may be beneficial 312 \nfor maintaining bone health in old er adults, although, as was observed for gait speed, SCPT was 313 \nnegatively associated with trabecular thickness at the distal tibia. It has been reported that increased 314 \nmechanical loading through physical activity leads to changes to morphological parameters other 315 \nthan trabecular thickness [40], and trabecular number appears more important than trabecular 316 \nthickness for maintaining bone strength [41, 42]. Hence, a negative association may not be a clinically 317 \nsignificant finding and it should also be noted that trabecular thickness is a derived measurement 318 \nfrom HRpQCT rather than a directly measured bone parameter [23]. As a result, assessments of 319 \nmuscle power in clinical practice a ppears potentially useful for screening for poor bone health in 320 \npostmenopausal women. 321 \nThe results of this study are subject to limitations including its cross -sectional design, which 322 \nlimits conclusions on causality of any observed associations. It is likely that poorer bone health 323 \ncontributes to functional decline, poor HRQoL and fear of falling in postmenopausal women, but we 324 \ndid not ascertain whether previous falls and fractures influenced these relationships. The study had 325 \na relatively small sample size and it is unclear whether these results can be generalized to either men 326 \nor populations with normal aBMD. Hence, longitudinal studies should be conducted in larger 327 \npopulations to confirm if objective measures of physical function are stronger and better predictors 328 \n\nJ. Clin. Med. 2019, 8, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 14 \n \nof decline in bone health compared with self-reported HRQoL and fear of falls questionnaires. The 329 \nstrengths of the study include a well-defined sample of women with poor bone health, the use of both 330 \nobjective and self-reported measures of physical function, and advanced imaging of bone including 331 \nHRpQCT. 332 \nIn conclusion, a clinical assessment of muscle power was more consistently associated with 333 \nmicroarchitectural bone parameters compared with other measures of physical function, and self -334 \nadministered HRQoL and fear of falling questionnaires, in postmenopausal women with low aBMD. 335 \nIn the absence of access to bone imaging devices such as DXA and HRpQCT, and given their 336 \nconcurrent association with risk of falls, it may be beneficial for clinicians to incorporate measures of 337 \nmuscle power in order to screen for poor bone health in older adults. Furthermore, interventions 338 \ntargeting improvements in muscle power may be effective in improving bone health in 339 \npostmenopausal women at risk of osteoporosis. 340 \nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, P.R.E. and D.S.; methodology, D.S.; formal analysis, A.G.; 341 \ninvestigation, C.N. and L.B.M.; resources, P.R.E. and D.S.; data curation, C.N. and L.B.M.; writing-original draft 342 \npreparation, A.G.; software, L.H., writing-review and editing, A.G., L.B.M., C.N., A.Z., P.R.E. and D.S.; 343 \nsupervision, D.S., A.Z., M.P.B. and P.R.E.; project administration, C.N., L.B.M., and D.S.; funding acquisition, 344 \nP.R.E. and D.S. 345 \nFunding: This research was funded by Monash University, Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences 346 \nStrategic Grant (SGS16 -0388) awarded t o DS.

Assessments were based on low scores for appendicular lean mass (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry),\nhand grip strength, and the Timed Up and Go test. For 7 days after baseline, total time and total number of bouts (/C2110 min of continuous activity\nat a given intensity) of activity performed at sedentary, LPA, and MVPA intensities were assessed by accelerometer. Incident falls were\nself-reported 6 months and 12 months after baseline.\nResults: Only 1.8% of participants had probable or conﬁrmed sarcopenia. After multivariable adjustment for other levels of activity, only greater\nMVPA time was associated with a decreased likelihood of having low appendicular lean mass, low hand grip strength, and slow Timed Up and\nGo time as deﬁned by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People criteria (allp < 0.05), and only MVPA time was associated\nwith lower likelihood of probable or conﬁrmed sarcopenia (odds ratio = 0.80, 95% conﬁdence interval: 0.71/C00.91 h/week). Similar associations\nwere identiﬁed for total number of bouts, with no evidence of threshold effects for longer duration of bouts of MVPA. A total of 14% of partici-\npants reported/C211 fall, but neither total time nor bouts of activity was associated with incident falls (allp > 0.05).\nConclusion: Higher amounts of accelerometer-determined MVPA are consistently associated with a decreased likelihood of sarcopenia and its\ncomponents, regardless of the length of bouts or amounts of sedentary behavior.\nKeywords: Accelerometer; Falls; Older adults; Physical activity; Sarcopenia\n1. Introduction\nSarcopenia, a muscle disease arising from adverse muscle\nchanges accruing across the lifetime, recently received an\nupdated operational deﬁnition from the European Working\nGroup on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP). 1 The\nrevised EWGSOP deﬁnition (EWGSOP2) differs from the\noriginal one (EWGSOP1) in terms of suggested measure-\nments, cut-off points, and case-ﬁnding algorithms. In EWG-\nSOP2, physical performance assessments are used only to\nassess the severity of sarcopenia. This is in contrast to EWG-\nSOP1, where physical performance was a primary component\nof sarcopenia, and to the deﬁnition given by the U.S. Founda-\ntion for the National Institutes of Health, where physical per-\nformance is considered an outcome of sarcopenia. 2 These\nPeer review under responsibility of Shanghai University of Sport.\n* Corresponding author.\nE-mail address:david.scott@monash.edu (D.

Associations of accelerometer-determined physical activity and seden-\ntary behavior with sarcopenia and incident falls over 12 months in community-dwelling Swedish older adults.J Sport Health Sci2021;10:577/C084.\nAvailable online atwww.sciencedirect.com\nJournal of Sport and Health Science 10 (2021) 577/C0584\n\ndifferent approaches may partly explain controversial ﬁndings\nin terms of the relationships between sarcopenia and falls in\nolder adults.3 Nonetheless, we recently reported that older\nadults with sarcopenia, as deﬁned by the EWGSOP2, are more\nthan twice as likely to experience falls over 12 months com-\npared with those without sarcopenia.4\nCurrent World Health Organization physical activity (PA)\nguidelines recommend that adults 65 years and older complete\n150 min/week of moderate PA, 75 min/week of vigorous PA,\nor an equivalent amount of combined moderate-to-vigorous\nPA (MVPA), with aerobic activities performed in bouts (con-\ntinuous activity performed above the MVPA threshold)5 of\n/C2110 min.6 Accelerometers are a useful tool for objectively\nestimating total duration and total bouts of sedentary behavior,\nlight PA (LPA), and MVPA. We previously reported that total\namount and intensity of accelerometer-determined PA is posi-\ntively associated with lean mass and muscle strength in older\nadults, whereas sedentary behavior demonstrates inconsistent\nassociations.7 Despite concerns that greater amounts of MVPA\nmay expose older adults to an increased risk of falls, older\nwomen with low accelerometer-determined MVPA demon-\nstrate increased falls rates.8 It is unclear whether the length\nof bouts of different activity intensities inﬂuences their\nassociations with sarcopen ia and falls, so determining\nwhether a threshold effect exists is important for public\nhealth messaging.\nExercise, particularly resistance training, is recommended\nas the primary treatment strategy for sarcopenia,9 and func-\ntional activities and balance training seem to be key for the\nprevention of falls.10 While strength training is recommended\nin current PA guidelines, they focus primarily on general PA\nrather than targeted exercise.11 It is therefore important to\nunderstand associations of general PA with sarcopenia and\nfalls. The aim of this study was to determine associations of\naccelerometer-determined totalduration and number of bouts of\nsedentary behavior, LPA, and MVPA with EWGSOP2-deﬁned\nsarcopenia and its components, as well as their associations\nwith incidence of falls over 12 months.\n2.",
    "materials and methods": "2.1. Study design and participants\nThe Healthy Ageing Initiative is an ongoing observational\nstudy of 70-year-old adults residing in the Umea\n/C14\nmunicipality\nin northern Sweden. The primary objectives of the Healthy\nAgeing Initiative are to investigate traditional and novel risk\nfactors for cardiovascular disease and injurious falls and frac-\ntures in 70-year-old men and women. Only 2 eligibility criteria\napply: speciﬁcally, that the individual is residing in the Umea\n/C14\nmunicipal area and is 70 years of age at the time of testing.\nPotentially eligible individuals were sent written information\nabout the study, with contact information drawn from popula-\ntion registers. Individuals either accepted or declined to partic-\nipate during a follow-up phone call. The study participation\nrate was 69.5%. The Healthy Ageing Initiative was approved\nby the Umea\n/C14\nUniversity Research Ethics Committee and com-\nplied with the World Medical Association’s Declaration of\nHelsinki. All participants provided written informed consent.\nThe current analysis included the ﬁrst 3334 participants with\ncomplete data for demographics, components of sarcopenia,\nand accelerometer-determined PA.\n2.2. Baseline clinic appointment\nParticipants attended a hospital near Umea\n/C14\nUniversity for a\nbaseline clinic appointment, where they completed assess-\nments (detailed elsewhere in this article) and also had fasting\nblood tests from which plasma glucose was analyzed. Height\nand weight were assessed by stadiometer (Holtain Limited,\nCrymych, Dyfed, UK) and scales (Avery Berkel HL 120,\nSmethwick, West Midlands, UK), respectively, and body mass\nindex (BMI; kg/m2) was calculated. Participants also com-\npleted a questionnaire that assessed demographics, lifestyle,\nand medical history. A Lunar iDXA (GE Healthcare Lunar,\nMadison, WI, USA) whole body scan was performed to assess\nsoft-tissue composition (total fat mass and appendicular lean\nmass (ALM)). Hand grip strength (HGS) was assessed using\nan isokinetic hand dynamometer (Jamar; Patterson Medical,\nWarrenville, IL, USA). Research nurses instructed the partici-\npant to hold the hand dynamometer in their nondominant\nhand, maintain a 90˚ angle at the elbow joint, and keep the\nelbow in close proximity to the waist. The research nurses fur-\nther instructed the participant to, on command, start squeezing\nthe hand dynamometer as forcefully as possible. The best of 2\nattempts was subsequently recorded. The Timed Up and Go\n(TUG) test12 was performed once to assess physical perfor-\nmance; participants were asked to rise unaided from an arm-\nchair and walk forward 3 m, then to turn around and return to\na seated position in the chair. Research nurses provided\ninstructions and a demonstration of the task, and measured\nTUG time using a stopwatch.\n2.3. Accelerometer-determined PA\nParticipants wore a triaxial accelerometer (GT3X+; Acti-\ngraph, Pensacola, FL, USA) for 7 days after the clinic appoint-\nment as described previously.13 Participants were instructed to\nwear the accelerometer on their nondominant hip and to\nremove it only when showering, swimming, or in bed at night.\nTo obtain representative accelerometer measurements, partici-\npants were also instructed to be normally active in accordance\nwith their current lifestyle. Participants who did not provide\n/C214 days (including /C2110 h/day) of valid measurements had\naccelerometer data excluded (approximately 10% of partici-\npants were excluded due to nonvalid wear time).14 Accelerom-\neter data were collected at a frequency of 30 Hz, and data were\ntransformed into counts of movement with an activity thresh-\nold of 100 counts per min (cpm). Collected data were down-\nloaded using ActiLife software (Version 6.11.2; Actigraph,\nPensacola, FL, USA) in epoch lengths of 60 s, with subsequent\nwear time validation performed. Periods of/C2160 min with 0\nactivity were marked as nonwear time. Sedentary behavior\nwas classiﬁed as 1/C099 cpm, LPA was classiﬁed as 100/C01951\ncpm, and MVPA was classiﬁed as/C211952 cpm, as proposed by\nFreedson et al.15 MVPA was calculated as the sum of moderate\n578 D. Scott et al.\n\nand vigorous PA; these PA intensities were combined due to\nlow amounts of vigorous activity in this cohort.16 Total time\n(h/week) was calculated for each activity threshold, as well as\nthe total number of bouts (instances of continuous activity\nwithin the respective activity threshold for each of sedentary\nbehavior, LPA, and MVPA) performed for each of the follow-\ning durations: 10/C019 min, 20/C029 min, 30/C039 min, 40/C049\nmin, 50/C059 min, and/C2160 min.\n2.4. Deﬁnition of sarcopenia\nThe EWGSOP2 categorizes probable sarcopenia as low\nmuscle strength only, conﬁrmed sarcopenia as low muscle\nstrength and low muscle mass, and severe sarcopenia as low\nmuscle strength, low muscle mass, and poor physical perfor-\nmance.1 The authors recently acknowledged a reporting error\nwith the published cut-point for ALM normalized to height.17\nDue to this confusion, absolute ALM was used as the measure\nof low muscle mass in this study. Hence, low muscle strength\nwas deﬁned as an HGS of<27 kg (men) or<16 kg (women),\nlow muscle mass as an ALM of<20.0 kg (men) or<15.0 kg\n(women), and low physical performance criteria as a TUG\ntime of/C2120 s.1 Due to the fact that there were low numbers of\nprobable and conﬁrmed sarcopenia, and no participants with\nsevere sarcopenia, in this cohort, participants were classiﬁed\nas having either no sarcopenia or probable or conﬁrmed sarco-\npenia for the purposes of the present analysis.\n2.5. Incident falls over 12 months\nAt 6 months and 12 months after the baseline clinical appoint-\nment, participants were contacted by a research nurse by tele-\nphone to determine incident falls since the appointment.18\nParticipants were asked whether they experienced any falls that\nwere low energy (i.e., falls from standing height), where they had\nunexpectedly come to rest on the ground (rather than any lower\nlevel) by himself or herself. Individuals who reported/C211f a l l s\nover 12 months were classiﬁed as fallers, and individuals who\nreported/C212f a l l sw e r ea d d i t i o n a l l yc l a s s i ﬁ e da sm u l t i p l ef a l l e r s .19\n2.6. Statistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (Ver-\nsion 25.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Data were initially\nchecked for normality, and nonparametric tests were used\nwhere appropriate. Descriptive data were presented as mean§\nSD or median (interquartile range) for continuous variables or\nfrequencies for categorical variables. Differences in participant\ncharacteristics according to sarcopenia status (no sarcopenia\nvs. probable or conﬁrmed sarcopenia) were determined using\nindependent samplest tests or Mann-WhitneyU tests (continu-\nous variables), andx2 tests (categorical variables).\nMultivariable binary logistic regression models were\nused to determine odds for sarcopenia and its components,\nand 12-month incident falls, per 1-h increase in sedentary,\nLPA, and MVPA. An initial model was adjusted for sex,\nBMI, and smoking status, andas u b s e q u e n tm o d e lw a sf u r -\nther adjusted for other activity variables (e.g., sedentary\nbehavior was adjusted for LPA and MVPA). Additionally,\ngiven that sedentary behavior, LPA, and MVPA may have\nU-shaped associations with incident falls and multiple falls,\nthese outcomes were compared across quartiles of seden-\ntary behavior, LPA, and MVPA using x2 tests and multi-\nvariable binary logistic regression analyses.\nIndependent samplest tests were used to compare means for\ntotal number of bouts per week at each duration for sedentary\nbehavior, LPA, and MVPA between participants without sarco-\npenia and those with probable or conﬁrmed sarcopenia. Multi-\nvariable binary logistic regression analyses were then\nperformed to determine likelihood of sarcopenia and falls for\neach additional bout per week of sedentary behavior, LPA, and\nMVPA lasting for durations of 10/C019 min, 20/C029 min, 30/C039\nmin, 40/C049 min, 50/C059 min, and /C2160 min. These analyses\nwere adjusted for sex, BMI, smoking status, and number of\nbouts of the same duration for other activity variables (i.e., sed-\nentary bouts lasting 10/C019 min were adjusted for LPA bouts\nlasting 10/C019 min and MVPA bouts lasting 10/C019 min).\nFinally, multivariable linear regression models explored the\nassociations of total time and number of bouts of sedentary behav-\nior, LPA, and MVPA with components of sarcopenia (continuous\nvariables). These analyses were adjusted for sex, BMI, and smok-\ning status, as well as for total accelerometer wear time (total time\nanalyses) or number of bouts of the same duration for other activ-\nity levels (bout analyses). For all analyses, collinearity diagnos-\ntics, including variance inﬂation factors and tolerance values,\nwere used to check for multicollinearity. Values ofp < 0.05 were\nconsidered statistically signiﬁcant.\n3. Results\nOf 3633 participants initially recruited for this study, 3334\n(50.5% women) had complete anthropometric, accelerometer,\nand physical function data.Table 1presents characteristics for\nparticipants classiﬁed as nonsarcopenic (98.2%), compared\nwith probable (0.8%) or conﬁrmed sarcopenic (1.0%). No par-\nticipant met the criteria for severe sarcopenia. There were no\ndifferences in the proportion of men and women for the sarco-\npenic and nonsarcopenic groups, but sarcopenic participants\nwere signiﬁcantly more likely to be smokers. Sarcopenic par-\nticipants tended to have lower BMI, but higher total body fat\npercentage, although these differences did not achieve statisti-\ncal signiﬁcance. As expected, sarcopenic participants had sig-\nniﬁcantly lower ALM and HGS, and higher TUG time, than\nnonsarcopenic participants. There were no differences between\ngroups for the total time spent wearing accelerometers, seden-\ntary behavior, or LPA. However, the mean time spent in\nMVPA was signiﬁcantly lower in the sarcopenic group com-\npared to the nonsarcopenic group.\nTable 2reports the odds ratios for sarcopenia and its compo-\nnents according to time (h) spent in sedentary behavior, LPA, or\nMVPA. After adjustment for sex, BMI, and smoking status\n(Model 1), each 1 h/week increase in sedentary behavior was\nassociated with a 1% reduced likelihood of having low ALM,\nbut this association was not signiﬁcant after further adjustment\nfor LPA and MVPA (Model 2). Conversely, both LPA and\nPhysical activity, sarcopenia, and falls 579\n\nMVPA were associated with a reduced likelihood of having low\nALM after full adjustment (2% and 12% reductions 1 h/week\nincrease, respectively). Only MVPA was associated with HGS,\nwith each 1 h/week increase in MVPA associated with a 20%\nreduced likelihood of having low HGS after full adjustment. In\nthe fully adjusted models, all intensities were associated with\nTUG; each 1 h/week increase in sedentary behavior was associ-\nated with a 4% increased likelihood of a high TUG time, and\neach 1-h increase in LPA and MVPA was associated with a\n12% and 66% reduced likelihood of high TUG time, respec-\ntively. However, only MVPA was associated with probable or\nconﬁrmed sarcopenia status. Each 1 h/week increase in MVPA\nwas associated with a 20% reduced likelihood for presence of\nsarcopenia in the fully adjusted model.\nAt 12 months after the clinic appointment, a total of 2748\nparticipants (82.4%) provided valid falls data, with 14% of these\nparticipants reporting/C211f a l la n do n l y1 %r e p o r t i n gm u l t i p l e\nfalls. After adjustment for sex, BMI, smoking, sarcopenia status,\nand time spent at other intensities, time spent in sedentary\nbehavior, LPA, and MVPA werenot associated with likelihood\nof any incident fall, or multiple falls, over 12 months (allp >\n0.05). Incident falls were further compared over quartiles of sed-\nentary behavior, LPA, and MVPA. Thex2 tests revealed that\nthere were no differences in incidence of any falls across quar-\ntiles of sedentary behavior, LPA, or MVPA (allp > 0.05).\nThere were also no differences in incidence of multiple falls\nacross quartiles of sedentary behavior or LPA (p =0 . 2 1 3 a n d\np =0 . 3 2 1 , r e s p e c t i v e l y ) .

The numbers\nof light activity bouts of the same duration were 66.8§ 33.9\nper week, 14.2§ 11.8 per week, 4.6§ 5.2 per week, 1.9§ 2.8\nper week, 0.9§ 1.7 per week, and 0.4§ 1.0 per week, respec-\ntively. Unsurprisingly, the numbers of sedentary bouts of these\ndurations were substantially greater: 186.2§ 45.1 per week,\n83.4 § 25.4 per week, 43.2§ 16.1 per week, 24.6§ 10.8 per\nweek, 14.2 § 7.5 per week, and 7.7§ 4.9 per week, respec-\ntively. The numbers of bouts of all durations for MVPA were\nsigniﬁcantly higher in nonsarcopenic compared with sarcopenic\nparticipants (Fig. 2): 10/C019 min (8.6§ 8.8 per weekvs. 4.9 § 6.8\nper week;p < 0.001), 20/C029 min (3.5§ 4.4 per weekvs. 1.9 §\n3.2 per week;p < 0.001), 30/C039 min (1.8§ 2.7 per weekvs. 0.8\n§ 1.6 per week;p < 0.001), 40/C049 min (1.0§ 1.8 per weekvs.\n0.4 § 0.9 per week;p < 0.001), 50/C059 min (0.5§ 1.3 per week\nvs. 0.2 § 0.5 per week;p < 0.001), and/C2160 min (0.3§ 0.8 per\nweek vs. 0.1 § 0.3 per week;p < 0.001). There were no differen-\nces in the numbers of bouts of any duration for LPA or sedentary\nbehavior between nonsarcopenic and sarcopenic participants (all\np > 0.05).\nAs demonstrated inTable 3,a f t e ra d j u s t m e n tf o rc o v a r i a t e s ,\nincluding bouts of the same duration for sedentary behavior and\nLPA, higher numbers of MVPA bouts per week of 10/C019 min,\n20/C029 min, 30/C039 min, 40/C049 min, and 50/C059 min retained an\nassociation with lower likelihoodf o rp r o b a b l eo rc o n ﬁ r m e ds a r c o -\npenia.

Scott et al.\n\nregression analyses were adjusted for covariates, including\ntotal time of accelerometer wear or bouts of the same duration\nfor other intensities. Sedentary behavior time and bouts were\nnot associated with ALM or HGS, but were signiﬁcantly posi-\ntively associated with TUG time, with the exception of\n10/C019 min bouts. LPA time and bouts were positively associ-\nated with ALM but not HGS, and negatively associated with\nTUG time. MVPA time and bouts were positively associated\nwith both ALM and HGS, but only for bouts up to and includ-\ning 40/C049 min for HGS. MVPA time and bouts were nega-\ntively associated with TUG time. With the exception of\nMVPA and HGS, where bouts of>50 min demonstrated non-\nsigniﬁcant associations and also lower coefﬁcients than bouts\nof shorter duration, there did not seem to be threshold effects\nin the associations of increasing bout durations with sarcopenia\ncomponents.\n4. Discussion\nThis population-based study of Swedish community-\ndwelling 70-year-olds demonstrated that higher total amounts\nand bouts of accelerometer-determined MVPA are consistently\nand independently associated with a reduced likelihood of\nprobable or conﬁrmed sarcopenia, but not 12-month incident\nfalls. There was generally no evidence of a threshold effect for\nbouts of increasing duration in terms of their associations with\nsarcopenia and its components.\nFig. 1.

Indeed, Aggio et al.21 reported no associa-\ntion between accelerometer-determined MVPA and EWG-\nSOP1 sarcopenia in older men, but reported a signiﬁcant\ndecrease in the risk of severe sarcopenia. Similarly, higher\nMVPA was not associated with a lower likelihood of having\nsarcopenia according to EWGSOP1 in the UK Hertfordshire\ncohort study,22 but the Toledo Study of Healthy Aging demon-\nstrated a 48% reduction in likelihood of sarcopenia per 1 h/day\nincrease in objectively determined MVPA, according to U.S.\nFoundation for the National Institutes of Health criteria (which\ninclude more conservative cut-off points for muscle function\nthan EWGSOP1).23 Taken together with our own observation\nof a consistent association between MVPA total time and bouts\nwith EWGSOP2 sarcopenia, it is possible that the beneﬁts of\nMVPA for preventing sarcopenia are most apparent for sarco-\npenia deﬁnitions that use more conservative cut-off points.\nPrevious research has also demonstrated that accelerome-\nter-determined MVPA is associated with individual compo-\nnents of sarcopenia. In Tasmanian older adults, accelerometer-\ndetermined PA performed at light and moderate intensity was\npositively associated with ALM, whereas sedentary behavior\nhad inconsistent associations with ALM.7 This ﬁnding is in\nagreement with the ﬁndings of the present study, where total\ntime and bouts of LPA and MVPA, but not sedentary behavior,\nwere consistently positively associated with ALM. A study of\n123 community-dwelling older Australians observed an asso-\nciation of longer sitting time with greater absolute lean mass\n(1.2 kg per 1 h of sitting time, 95% conﬁdence interval:\n0.44/C01.96; p < 0.01), but with signiﬁcantly lower lean mass\npercentage, suggesting that perhaps sedentary behavior is asso-\nciated more strongly with increases in total body mass rather\nthan muscle mass speciﬁcally.24\nFoong et al.7 also observed that light, moderate, and vigor-\nous PA, but not sedentary behavior, were all positively associ-\nated with lower limb strength. In the present study, only\nMVPA was positively associated with HGS, and this may\nreﬂect differences in common activities undertaken at different\nintensities; for example, MVPA may be more likely than LPA\nto include exercise involving upper limb contractions, whereas\nTable 4\nMultivariable linear regression analyses for associations of total time and number of bouts of sedentary behavior, LPA, and MVPA with HGS, ALM, and TUG.\nNumber of bouts of increasing durationa\nTotal time (h)\n10/C019 min 20 /C029 min 30 /C039 min 40 /C049 min 50 /C059 min /C2160 min\nALM (kg)\nSedentary 0.002 ( /C00.004 to 0.008) 0.001 ( /C00.001 to 0.003) 0.002 ( /C00.001,0.005) 0.002 ( /C00.003 to 0.007) 0.002 ( /C00.005 to 0.010) 0.004 ( /C00.006 to 0.015) 0.008 ( /C00.008 to 0.024)\nLPA 0.011 (0.003 to 0.019) 0.005 (0.002 to 0.007) 0.015 (0.008 to 0.022) 0.028 (0.013 to 0.043) 0.037 (0.009 to 0.065) 0.039 ( /C00.007 to 0.086) 0.079 (0.001 to 0.157)\nMVPA 0.101 (0.074 to 0.128) 0.031 (0.022 to 0.040) 0.052 (0.034 to 0.070) 0.092 (0.063 to 0.121) 0.104 (0.060 to 0.148) 0.126 (0.064 to 0.187) 0.164 (0.070 to 0.257)\nHGS (kg)\nSedentary 0.006 ( /C00.010 to 0.023) 0.002 ( /C00.003 to 0.007) 0.004 ( /C00.005 to 0.013) 0.003 ( /C00.011 to 0.016) 0.002 ( /C00.018 to 0.022) /C00.005 (/C00.033 to 0.024) /C00.007 (/C00.051 to 0.037)\nLPA 0.011 ( /C00.012 to 0.034) 0.005 ( /C00.002 to 0.011) 0.016 ( /C00.004 to 0.035) 0.029 ( /C00.013 to 0.072) 0.047 ( /C00.031 to 0.126) 0.056 ( /C00.072 to 0.184) 0.012 ( /C00.202 to 0.227)\nMVPA 0.145 (0.071 to 0.220) 0.038 (0.014 to 0.063) 0.057 (0.008 to 0.107) 0.121 (0.040 to 0.401) 0.126 (0.005 to 0.248) 0.093 (/C00.078 to 0.263) 0.053 ( /C00.205 to 0.310)\nTUG (s)\nSedentary 0.010 (0.004 to 0.016) 0.002 (0.000 to 0.003) 0.004 (0.001 to 0.008) 0.009 (0.004 to 0.014) 0.015 (0.008 to 0.023) 0.028 (0.017 to 0.038) 0.041 (0.025 to 0.057)\nLPA /C00.028 (/C00.036 to/C00.019) /C00.009 (/C00.011 to/C00.007) /C00.020 (/C00.027 to/C00.013) /C00.036 (/C00.051 to/C00.020) /C00.054 (/C00.083 to/C00.026) /C00.074 (/C00.121 to/C00.027) /C00.114 (/C00.193 to/C00.035)\nMVPA /C00.105 (/C00.132 to/C00.078) /C00.033 (/C00.042 to/C00.024) /C00.061 (/C00.079 to/C00.043) /C00.085 (/C00.115 to/C00.056) /C00.103 (/C00.147 to/C00.058) /C00.105 (/C00.167 to/C00.042) /C00.122 (/C00.217 to/C00.028)\nNotes: All data areb-coefﬁcients (95% conﬁdence intervals).

Scott et al.\n\nLPA may most commonly involve walking. In support of this\npossibility, we observed that LPA (as well as MVPA) was\nindependently associated with better TUG time. TUG was the\nonly sarcopenia component for which sedentary behavior dem-\nonstrated a signiﬁcant association; greater amounts of seden-\ntary behavior were associated with poorer TUG time\nindependent of LPA and MVPA. The Toledo Study of Healthy\nAging reported that only MVPA was associated with gait\nspeed,23 but a separate study found that greater sedentary\nbehavior is associated with slower TUG time in a cohort of\nBritish 60-year-olds to 64-year-olds.25\nThe U.S. Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee\nrecently published an umbrella review concluding that regular\nPA delays loss of physical function and mobility and reduces\nrisk of fall-related injuries.26 Our results support the concept\nthat greater amounts of MVPA, for which the coefﬁcients were\nof substantially greater magnitude compared with LPA and sed-\nentary behavior, are associated with better physical function\n(handgrip strength, TUG, and probable or conﬁrmed sarcope-\nnia). It is unclear, however, why no associations were observed\nwith 12-month incident falls in multivariable models. This ﬁnd-\ning may be related to the fact that injurious falls were not\nassessed and/or the low overall incidence of falls observed.\nAlso, greater amounts of sedentary behavior, although likely to\ndeleteriously effect physical function and mobility, likely protect\nagainst falls by reducing ambulation and therefore exposures\nthat may cause falls. The incidence of multiple falls was lowest\nin the quartile with the greatest sedentary behavior (although\nthis difference was nonsigniﬁcant) and was signiﬁcantly higher\nin the lowest quartile of MVPA in unadjusted, but not adjusted,\nanalyses. Similarly, in a study of women aged 63/C099 years,\nthose in the lowest accelerometer-determined MVPA quartile\nhad 18% increased falls rates compared with those in the highest\nquartile,8 although sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the\nassociation was only present in women with poorer physical\nfunction or with a history of/C212f a l l s .I m p o r t a n t l y ,t h eﬁ n d i n g s\nof the previous study and our own demonstrate that greater\namounts of MVPA do not increase risk for falls. Given the clear\nbeneﬁts of MVPA for functional and other health outcomes,\nclinicians should have conﬁdence in recommending that older\npatients participate in activities at higher intensities.\nThis study is the ﬁrst we are aware of to examine whether\nthresholds exist for associations of PA bouts of increasing\nduration with sarcopenia and its components, as well as inci-\ndent falls. Current guidelines recommend accumulation of PA\nin bouts of /C2110 min based on data for cardiometabolic risk\nfactors, but accumulation of more PA bouts lasting/C2110 min is\nnot beneﬁcial beyond total volume of activity for reducing\nall-cause mortality in older men.27 We observed similar asso-\nciations for sarcopenia and its components in the present\nstudy; signiﬁcant associations between levels of activity and\nsarcopenia components were consistently observed for both\ntotal time of activity as well as number of bouts, suggesting\nthat the pattern in which activity is accumulated does not inﬂu-\nence these associations. Furthermore, there did not seem to be\na threshold at which the strength of association between bouts\nof increasing duration with sarcopenia outcomes was\ndiminished. The only exception was the association between\nMVPA and HGS, where the magnitude of the coefﬁcient\ndecreased and became nonsigniﬁcant for bouts of>49 min. It\nis possible that this ﬁnding is explained by the low numbers of\nMVPA bouts recorded at longer durations, and so it is likely\nthat increasing beneﬁts are obtained for lean mass and physical\nfunction with increasing duration bouts of activity of/C201 h.\nThe primary limitation of the present study is that the associ-\nations among PA, sedentary behavior, and sarcopenia and its\ncomponents are cross-sectional. Although higher PA is likely to\ncontribute to improved muscle function, it is equally likely that\nbetter muscle function enables participation in greater volumes\nand intensities of PA.28 Falls were assessed prospectively at 6\nmonths and 12 months, but only low-energy falls that resulted in\ncoming to rest at ground level were recorded, rather than falls\nresulting in coming to rest at any lower level (i.e., partial falls\nnot resulting in falling to the ground), as commonly deﬁned in\nother studies.29 The accelerometer cut-points for activity intensi-\nties used have been validated previously,15 but derived associa-\ntions with sarcopenia and falls may not be comparable with\nstudies using different accelerometer devices and cut-points.30\nFinally, as discussed previously, there was a low number of par-\nticipants with sarcopenia as deﬁned by EWGSOP2 in this com-\nmunity-dwelling cohort, and it is likely that our results cannot\nbe generalized to other older adult populations.\n5. Conclusion\nThe ﬁndings of this cohort study of Swedish older adults\nsuggest that clinicians should encourage older adults to partici-\npate in longer durations of weekly MVPA to reduce the risk for\ndeveloping sarcopenia, and that this type of activity can be per-\nformed without exposing older adults to increased falls risks.\nFurther prospective studies are required to determine causality\nin the relationship between MVPA and sarcopenia, and\nwhether beneﬁts of MVPA persist over the long term.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the Swedish Research Council\n(Grant number 2011-2976).

Sarcopenic obesity, characterized by age-induced\nskeletal-muscle atrophy and increased adiposity, may accelerate functional decline and increase\nthe risk of disability and mortality. In this review, we explore the inﬂuence of dietary protein on\nthe gut microbiome and its impact on sarcopenia and obesity. Given the associations between red\nmeat proteins and altered gut microbiota, a combination of plant and animal-based proteins are\ndeemed favorable for gut microbiota eubiosis and muscle-protein synthesis. Additionally, high-protein\ndiets with elevated essential amino-acid concentrations, alongside increased dietary ﬁber intake,\nmay promote gut microbiota eubiosis, given the metabolic e↵ects derived from short-chain fatty-acid\nand branched-chain fatty-acid production. In conclusion, a greater abundance of speciﬁc gut bacteria\nassociated with increased satiation, protein synthesis, and overall metabolic health may be driven by\nprotein and ﬁber consumption. This could counteract the development of sarcopenia and obesity\nand, therefore, represent a novel approach for dietary recommendations based on the gut microbiota\nproﬁle. However, more human trials utilizing advanced metabolomic techniques to investigate the\nmicrobiome and its relationship with macronutrient intake, especially protein, are warranted.\nKeywords: sarcopenia; obesity; gut microbiota; sarcopenic obesity; skeletal muscle; protein; older\nadults; short-chain fatty acids\n1. Introduction\nOlder population numbers are expected to rise dramatically over the upcoming decades across\nthe globe. By 2050, the worldwide population of those aged over 65 years is projected to increase by\napproximately 10%, reaching 2.1 billion [1]. It is estimated that metabolic syndrome is prevalent in\n12–26% and 12–37% of the European and Asian population, respectively [2]. Metabolic syndrome is\noutlined by skeletal-muscle-insulin resistance, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and abdominal obesity [3].\nIn aging populations, prolonged malnutrition is linked to metabolic syndrome-related diseases,\nNutrients 2020, 12, 2285; doi:10.3390/nu12082285 www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients\n\nNutrients 2020, 12, 2285 2 of 24\nincluding sarcopenia and obesity, which may emerge from increased body fat, proinﬂammatory\ncytokines, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, hormonal changes, and insulin resistance [4].\nSarcopenia is characterized by an age-related loss of skeletal-muscle mass and function, beginning in our\n30s and 40s and being highly prevalent entering our sixth decade [5]. Sarcopenia is often accompanied by\nloss of balance, increased morbidity, and frailty due to deterioration of muscle ﬁbers [6], restricting the\nability of individuals to remain physically active, leading to subsequent disabilities and dependency [7,8].\nThe onset of sarcopenia includes inﬂammatory responses, oxidative stress, reduced energy expenditure,\nand decreased appetite [9,10]. Although several deﬁnitions of sarcopenia are currently available,\nincluding the recently revised European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP)\ndeﬁnition, the lack of a universal consensus on deﬁnition limits comparison between studies and\namongst various population groups [11]. The prevalence of sarcopenia is largely inﬂuenced by the\ndeﬁnition used, and the lack of a consensus also makes it di\u0000cult for clinicians to identify older adults\nat risk of this condition [12]. In addition, approximately 30% of the population globally is classiﬁed as\noverweight or obese, highlighting an additional public health and ﬁnancial burden [13]. Obesity is\ncaused by chronic positive energy balance, leading to increased proinﬂammatory cytokine expression,\nadipocyte and immune dysfunction, and insulin resistance, which contribute to a range of metabolic\ndiseases [14], including type 2 diabetes and cancer [15]. A body mass index (BMI)> 30 kg/m2 and\na waist circumference over 102 cm and 88 cm for men and women, respectively, have been used as\nmeasures identifying obese populations [16]. In the United States, 38% of males and 39% of females\nover the age of 60 are considered obese [17], whereas the proportion of adults above a BMI of 25 kg/m2\nincreased by 8% in the period of 1980–2013 [18].\nGut microbiota dysbiosis is linked to age-related systemic inﬂammation, leading to impaired\nmuscle function and increased proinﬂammatory cytokines, which are associated with higher risk of\nobesity [19]. Gut microbiota dysregulation may promote the onset of sarcopenia and obesity through\nmyostatin and atrogin-1 expression [20] and dysfunctional signaling between the enteric nervous\nsystem and the brain, respectively [21], imposing a negative impact on muscle mass and appetite.\nNutrition may be a pivotal contributor to gut microbiota regulation, although di↵erent macronutrients\npromote distinct properties on the microbiome [22]. Short-chain fatty-acid (SCFA) production from\ndietary ﬁber is suggested as a prominent mediator of the gut microbiota through bacterial fermentation\nin the gastrointestinal tract, interacting with several gut–brain signaling pathways [23]. In addition,\nconsidering the skeletal muscle anabolic e↵ects of dietary protein, induction of increased protein\nintakes above the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) 0.8 g/kg/day is considered a valuable tool\nto counteract the gradual muscle loss and increased appetite for food [24]—a main characteristic of\nsarcopenic obesity. However, questions have been raised regarding the e↵ects of dietary proteins on\nthe gut microbiota and the health impact induced by their bioactive end-products [25].\nIn this review, we discuss how dietary protein may inﬂuence the gut microbiota ecosystem and\nits potential role in sarcopenia and obesity. We further aim to provide perspectives on novel future\ndietary recommendations, focusing primarily on the potential anabolic-induced e↵ects that emerge\nfrom elevated protein and ﬁber consumption.\n2. Sarcopenia and Obesity\nSarcopenia is accompanied by a greater incidence of comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes and\nobesity [26–28], which are indicative of the devastating e↵ects derived by systemic inﬂammation and\ninsulin resistance [29]. In obese older individuals, the catabolic-induced aging and obesogenic\nenvironments associated with sedentary behavior and malnutrition may lead to gradual fat\naccumulation in adipose tissue and simultaneous impaired skeletal-muscle atrophy, leading to\na condition known as sarcopenic obesity [30,31]. Sarcopenic obese older adults are often perceived\nas “fat–frail” due to the weakness and poor mobility associated with sarcopenia potentially being\nexacerbated by excess bodyweight from obesity [32]. Recent evidence indicates that the coexistence of\nsarcopenia and obesity is associated with adverse musculoskeletal outcomes [33], accelerated functional\n\nNutrients 2020, 12, 2285 3 of 24\ndecline, and worse disability compared with those with sarcopenia or obesity alone, or neither\nsarcopenia nor obesity [34]. This may lead to increased incidence of falls [35,36] and, combined\nwith the apparent loss of any protective e↵ect of obesity for fractures [37], sarcopenic obesity may\nperpetuate disability and poor quality of life [38]. Recently, there has been conjecture over whether\nhigh fat mass does in fact increase the risk of functional decline in older age beyond the e↵ects of\nsarcopenia alone [39]. Nonetheless, urgency is required for recommendations on proper diagnosis and\nmanagement of sarcopenic obesity, because each component is a potentially modiﬁable risk factor for\npoor metabolic health and mortality risk [40]. Like sarcopenia, clinical recognition of sarcopenic obesity\namong older patients is limited due to a lack of consensus on deﬁnitions, but presentations related to\nthis condition will increase substantially with concurrent obesity epidemics and aging of populations\ninternationally [31]. Currently, dietary recommendations for sarcopenic obesity involve high-protein,\nhypocaloric diets intended to improve body composition [31,41]. Considering that physical frailty may\nbe a pivotal obstacle to aerobic and resistance exercise performance, greater attention should be paid to\nmultiple domains of nutritional strategies. A developing ﬁeld in the role of optimal dietary patterns\nfor sarcopenia and obesity management is characterizing the ideal eubiosis of the gut microbiota\necosystem [42,43].\n3. Gut Microbiota and Immune and Metabolic Homeostasis\n3.1. Types and Functions of Gut Microbiota\nThe human gut is colonized by numerous microorganisms (e.g., bacteria, eukaryotic microbes,\nviruses, fungi, archaea), which are considered a contributor to a range of physiological functions,\nsuch as strengthening the gut integrity [44], regulating host immunity [45], and maintaining\nmetabolic health [46]. A recent study showed that the ratio of human to bacterial cells is\nalmost 1:1 [47]. The major phylogenetic types within the digestive tract consist of Bacteroidetes\n(Porphytomonas, Prevotella), Firmicutes (Ruminococcus, Clostridium, andEubacteria), Proteobacteria with\nminor groups of Actinobacteria (Biﬁdobacterium), Acidobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Verrumicrobia [48].\nFirmicutes (Lactobacillus, Veillonella) and Proteobacteria (Helicobacter) are dominant in the proximal gut,\nwhereas Firmicutes (Lachnospiraceae) and Bacteroidetes are observed in the colon [49,50]. The di↵erent\ntypes of gut microbiota are illustrated extensively in Figure1.\n\nNutrients 2020, 12, 2285 4 of 24\nNutrients 2020, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 24 \n \n \nFigure 1.

Adapted from [51]. \nDue to the antimicrobial effects of gastric and b ile-acid secretion, a relatively low number of \nmicrobiota are present in the stomach and the pr oximal small intestine [52]. The composition and \nproperties of the microbiome may depend on th eir occupation, as microb ial populations at the \nmucosa surface and the lumen interact with the ho st immune system and the metabolic effects of \nfood, respectively [53]. The gut microbiome has a critical role in the immune system through the \nprevention of pathogen colonization, stimulation of immunoglobulin A production, upregulation of \nanti-inflammatory cytokines, and T cell regulation [53]. For instance, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and \nBifidobacterium infantis may result in the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 \nand regulate T cell activation against the pathogen-stimulated NF- κB inflammatory pathway [54]. \nOther species may additionally induce lower inflammation levels by interleukin-17 expression, \nassisting host immunity in the protection of detrimental pathogens [55] . Furthermore, the gut \nmicrobiome is critical in the de novo synthesis of e s s e n t i a l v i t a m i n s , s u c h as vitamin B12, folate, \nvitamin K, nicotinic acid, pyridoxine, and others [46], as well as bile acids [56].

A catalogue of the functional capacity of the human gut microbiome\nidentiﬁed 9,879,896 genes wherein country-speciﬁc microbial signatures were found suggesting that\ngut microbiota composition is a↵ected by multiple factors, such as host genetics, diet, health status,\naging [58–60], and antibiotic administration [61].\n3.2. Gut Ecosystem and Metabolic Health\nThe gut microbiota has a substantial impact on the regulation of metabolic processes,\nincluding nutrient and amino-acid metabolism [62,63]. Alterations in microbial composition may\noccur within 24 h following a change in dietary patterns [64], although greater changes may\nrequire a long-term adherence [65]. Microbial alterations are associated with multiple diseases,\nsuch as cancer, sarcopenia, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases [48,66,67]. An association between\ngreater medication use with increased incidence of physical frailty and sarcopenia has been\nobserved, which may be partly explained by the potential impact of polypharmacy on microbiota\ncomposition [68]. Indeed, distinct di↵erences in the microbiota of healthy and frail older adults\nmay partially explain the onset of frailty and sarcopenia [69] through e↵ects on the mTOR signaling\npathway—a major proponent of muscle protein synthesis (MPS) [70]. Moreover, dysfunctional\nmusculoskeletal health has been suggested to be modulated by proinﬂammatory responses occurring\nin the microbiome [71]. Inﬂammatory responses associated with aging may induce microbial\nalterations inﬂuenced by pathogens, malnutrition, and lower overall lifestyle quality, leading to\nintestinal mucosa permeability [25,72,73]. Intestinal permeability initiates altered gut microbial\ncomposition (dysbiosis) and increases the levels of proinﬂammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6\n(IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-↵ (TNF-↵)[ 74,75]. Gut microbiota dysbiosis has a critical role\nin the gut–muscle axis through mitochondrial dysfunction, a↵ecting skeletal-muscle metabolism\nfurther [76–79]. This may be perpetuated by reactive-oxygen-species (ROS) production in the\nelderly [80], which activate the NF-B signaling pathway [81]—an activator of IL-6 and TNF-↵\nrelease [76]. In obese groups, microbial diversity is signiﬁcantly lower compared to lean population\ngroups [82]. Microbial diversity includingBiﬁdobacterium, Lactobacillus, Akkermansia, Fecalibacterium,\nEubacterium, Roseburia, Ruminococcus, andBlautia species are considered beneﬁcial for metabolic health in\nthe elderly [83,84]. For instance, in leukemia-disordered mice,Lactobacillus-species restoration reduced\nmuscle atrophy, which is also correlated with a decrease in various proinﬂammatory cytokines [85].\nOn the contrary, species, such asClostridium, Enterobacter, Enterococcus, andRuminococcus are associated\nwith altered energy balance and greater risk of obesity [51]. Multiple studies have linked dietary\npatterns with changes in the gut ecosystem, displaying a distinct role of macronutrients and their\nimpact on the gut microbiota environment [64,86]. However, the complexity in trying to understand\nthe metabolic e↵ects of gut microbiota and their relationship with detrimental health conditions is\nchallenging [87]. Most studies have been performed in mice, which share 95% similar gut microbiota\nfunctionality with humans [88].\nMoreover, alterations in gut microbiota composition are observed more commonly in people\nover the age of 65 compared to younger adults [89,90]. Higher microbial diversity from increased\nBiﬁdobacterium and Lactobacillus may promote more e\u0000cient nutrient absorption and amino-acid\nsynthesis, whereas low microbial diversity is associated with excess nutrient uptake and storage and\nincreased Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio [91,92]. A greater abundance of Firmicutes relative to\nBacteroides concentration is characterized in the microbiome of obese and insulin resistant humans and\nanimals [93,94]. Interestingly, decreasedBiﬁdobacterium levels are detected during aging, which is linked\nto increased circulating levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Elevated levels of the endotoxin LPS are\nmarked in obese and diabetic individuals, leading to gut microbiota dysbiosis, skeletal-muscle-insulin\nresistance and increased gut permeability [95–99]. LPS is a marker of endotoxemia, which promotes\nskeletal-muscle-insulin resistance by proinﬂammatory cytokine expression of TNF-↵, interleukin-1\n(IL-1), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and IL-6 [100,101]. This highlights the potential of age-related decrements\n\nNutrients 2020, 12, 2285 6 of 24\nin gut microbiota (e.g.,Biﬁdobacterium) to inﬂuence the development of sarcopenic obesity through\ndecreased glucose tolerance in the skeletal muscle [95,100,102–104]. Furthermore, inﬂammatory\ncytokines induced during aging by enhanced LPS levels have demonstrated suppressed protein\nsynthesis via muscle-protein synthesis and muscle-protein breakdown (MPS: MPB) imbalance,\nleading to reduced muscle mass and physical function [105–109]. In older adults, serum LPS and\ngene expression of its receptor, Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4), is linked to lower insulin sensitivity\ncompared to younger groups, showing that age-related LPS levels may increase the incidence of insulin\nresistance during aging [103,110]. Therefore, reductions in microbial diversity and functionality of\nthe host may inﬂuence the functionality of several organs, including the skeletal muscle [109,111,112].\nHowever, questions have been raised as to whether altered microbial diversity is caused by aging or if\nthe microbiome is responsible for the consequences derived by aging [113,114].\n4. Sarcopenic Obesity: A Case for Protein and Gut Microbiota\n4.1. Dietary Protein and Gut Microbiota\nProtein is the dominant macronutrient in weight-loss strategies combatting sarcopenic obesity,\ngiven its appetite-suppressive e↵ects [115] and anabolic e↵ects on maintaining MPS above MPB [116].\nThe G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) located in the L- and G-cells of the colon and the small\nintestine, respectively, modulate glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) secretion\nthrough amino-acid sensing, impeding the stimulation of food-intake regulatory e↵ects occurring in the\ngut–brain axis [117–119]. In addition, satiation is further augmented by cholecystokinin (CCK) release,\nwhich is stimulated by protein consumption [120]. Studies have conﬁrmed these e↵ects compared\nto dietary carbohydrates and fats consumption [121], which may be attributed to the regulation\nof leptin and ghrelin secretion [122–125]. It is worth mentioning that, appetite-induced responses\ndriven by signals between the gut microbiota and dietary protein may be determined by amino-acid\ncomposition [126] and, particularly, essential amino acids (i.e., leucine) [127,128]. Although dietary\nprotein is established as a competent appetite regulator, its satiating and anabolic e↵ects in older adults\nmay be alleviated following lower protein diets [129]. The current RDA for protein at 0.8 g/kg/day may\nbe insu\u0000cient for older adults due to their inability to absorb and utilize protein to the same extent\ncompared to younger individuals [106,108,130]. Recommendations for leucine consumption—around\n3–4 g per meal, which equates to 25–30 g of high quality protein and 1.0–1.6 g/kg/day distributed into\n3–4 daily meals—aim to promote greater MPS stimulation in older adults [131–134]. Dietary protein is\nthe gut microbiota’s primary source of amino acids, which can be used for protein synthesis and energy\nmetabolism [135]. Currently, there is a controversy around the gut microbiota and high-protein diets in\nmetabolic health and disease during aging. Microbiome changes are suggested to be engaged directly\nor indirectly in several mechanisms of age-related anabolic resistance, which may explain the necessity\nof greater protein intake in aging populations [136]. Anabolic resistance is associated with reduced\ngene expression in proteins involved in MPS, impaired protein absorption and digestion, loss of\nskeletal-muscle stem cells, and decreased amino-acid transportation in the skeletal muscle [19,137,138].\nFurthermore, malnutrition and a sedentary lifestyle are proponents of anabolic resistance, increasing\ngradually with aging [116]. This raises questions on the impact gut microbiota may have on metabolic\ndiseases, including the onset of sarcopenia and obesity [69].\nMost protein is digested and absorbed e\u0000ciently in the small intestine by pancreatic enzymes and\npeptidases used by enterocytes, although approximately 10% of proteins that pass through the small\nintestine may not be completely digested [139]. Going to the large intestine for further proteolysis by the\ncolonic microbiota, amino acids are not absorbed by the colonocytes as e\u0000ciently and some metabolites\nmay be used for metabolic or waste products [140,141]. The transit time and microbiota concentration\nis greater in the large than the small intestine, with bacterial proteases and peptidases breaking down\nendogenous and dietary proteins to peptides and amino acids [142]. The undigested proteins and\npeptides that reach the colon inﬂuence gut microbiota production and composition, contributing\n\nNutrients 2020, 12, 2285 7 of 24\nto large amounts of indigestible products [143–145]. Regarding this, as protein consumption is\nincreased, the amount of proteins reaching the colon is increasing correspondingly, leading to\nnumerous and diverse bacterial metabolite production (e.g., hydrogen sulﬁde, branched-chain\nfatty acids (BCFAs), SCFAs, polyamines, ammonia, methane, aromatic compounds, nitric oxide,\ntyramine, tryptamine, phenethylamine, serotonin, histamine, and others) in the gastrointestinal\ntract [141,146,147]. Some of these metabolic products are detrimental for metabolic health and are\nassociated with chronic inﬂammation and several diseases (e.g., inﬂammatory bowel disease, colorectal\ncancer). However, to date, there is no causal link in humans, taking into account the absence of\nlong-term experimental trials on high protein diets and the gut microbiome and their multifaceted\nrelationships [148,149].\nMultiple human and animal studies have linked increased branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs)\nwith insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in obese groups [150–153]. However, increased SCFA\nconsumption may alleviate the hyperglycemic responses that are occurring in obese and type 2\ndiabetics, characterized by elevated amino-acid concentrations [154]. In accordance, undigested\namino acids by the colonic epithelium may be used by the host through BCFA and SCFA\nactivity to regulate protein homeostasis and energy production by muscle cells [141,142,155,156].\nBCAA deamination leading to BCFA production is a marker of colonic fermentation developed by\nprotein consumption [147]. The conversion of BCAA valine, leucine, and isoleucine to isobutyrate,\nisovalerate, and 2-methylbutyrate, respectively [157], may contribute to approximately 5% of the total\nSCFA production [158]. This evidence indicates that the composition and concentration of amino acids\nmay play a pivotal role in the proteolytic fermentation by the gut microbiota in the small intestine,\nwhich inﬂuences amino-acid homeostasis [159,160]. Therefore, it is recommended that high-protein\ndiets should be carefully designed, considering the levels of protein fermentation by the gut microbiota\nand the amount of protein entering the large intestine [139,145].\n4.2. Protein Sources, Amino Acids, and Gut Microbiota Species\nIt is suggested that protein sources and amino-acid balance may inﬂuence gut microbial\ndiversity. For instance, plant proteins are associated with greater Biﬁdobacterium, Roseburia,\nRuminococcus bromii, Lactobacillus, and Roseburia content [161], as opposed toBacteroides, Alistipes,\nBilophila, and Clostridium perfrigens, found primarily in animal proteins [ 64,162]. A greater\nabundance of Bacteroidetes, Biﬁdobacterium, and decreased serum LPS levels compared to meat,\ndairy, and casein-protein consumption have been associated with soy-protein intake [163,164].\nFurthermore, increasedBiﬁdobacteria and Lactobacilli, which are linked to decreased diet-induced obesity\nand improved insulin sensitivity have been further supported by soy-protein consumption [165–167].\nLikewise, increased bile-acid transformation, GLP-1 secretion, elevatedLactobacillus and Biﬁdobacterium\nlevels, and reduced Firmicutes have been reported following soybean, mungbean, and buckwheat\nproteins [168,169]. In addition, Biﬁdobacteria-fermented whey and cheese protein have expressed\ndecreased populations ofBacteroides fragilisand Clostridium perﬁngens, increased acetate production,\nand greaterLactobacillus and Biﬁdobacterium diversity [170–172]. Moreover, certainLactobacillus and\nBiﬁdobacteria species have been associated with increased muscle strength, weight loss, and reduced\nobesogenic environments in humans and rodents [173–176]. This may be attributed to whey\nprotein’s abundance inLactobacillus and Biﬁdobacteria, as reported in rodent studies [177–179].\nRegarding this, higherLactobacillus abundance has been demonstrated from white-meat-protein\nconsumption, while supplementation ofLactobacillus plantarumhas resulted in increased muscle mass\nin mice [175,177,179–181]. Examples of gut microbiota studies incorporating di↵erent protein types\nand sources, and their metabolic e↵ects, are depicted in Table1.\n\nNutrients 2020, 12, 2285 8 of 24\nTable 1.Metabolic e↵ects of protein supplementation and gut microbiota interaction in selected animal\nand human studies.\nStudy Type Bacterial Type Metabolic E ↵ects References\nMale mice supplemented with BCAAs\nAkkermansia\"\nBiﬁdobacterium\"\nBacteroidetes\"\nProteobacteria#\nActinobacteria#\nFirmicutes#\nWeight change$\nLPS# [182]\nPigs supplemented with Leucine\nActinobacteria\"\nLactobacillus\"\nFirmicutes\"\nFat oxidation\"\nSCFAs\"\nLDL cholesterol#\nFat mass#\n[183]\nMice supplemented with Taurine Proteobacteria\"\n(Helicobacter)\nSCFAs\"\nLPS# [184]\nMice fed with whey isolate vs. casein\nfor 21 weeks\nLactobacillus\"\nClostridium#\nLean mass\"\nLeptin#\nFat mass#\n[179]\nMice fed with buckwheat vs. casein\nprotein diets for 6 weeks\nLactobacillus\"\nBiﬁdobacterium\"\nEnterococcus\"\nClostridium\"\nBacteroides#\nSCFAs\"\nTNF-↵#\nIL-6#\nLPS#\n[169]\nMice fed with mungbean protein\nisolate for 4 weeks\nBacteroidetes\"\nFirmicutes#\nGLP-1\"\nPYY$\nInsulin$\n[168]\nHamsters supplemented with soy vs.\nmilk protein\nBiﬁdobacteria\"\nClostridiales\"\nBacteroidetes#\nProteobacteria#\n(Helicobacter)\nLDL cholesterol#\nHbA1c# [164]\nEndurance athletes supplemented with\nwhey isolate+ beef hydrolysate for\n10 weeks\nBacteroidetes\"\nBiﬁdobacterium\nlongum#\nRoseburia#\nBlautia#\n-[ 185]\nHealthy humans supplemented with\nBiﬁdobacterium breve C50-fermented\nwhey protein for 7 days\nBiﬁdobacteria\"\nBacteroides fragilis#\nClostridium\nperfringens#\nB-galactosidase\"\nNitroreductase#\n\u0000-glucuronidase#\n[170]\n# indicates decrease;\" indicates increase;$ indicates no change. SCFAs: Short-chain fatty acids, LDL: Low-density\nlipoprotein, TNF-↵: Tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-6: Interleukin-6, PYY: Peptide YY, HbA1c: Glycated hemoglobin.\nFurthermore, greater SCFA content and reduced Proteobacteria (Helicobacter) have been\nfound in mice supplemented with seafood protein, which is characterized by increased taurine\nlevels [184,186]. Additionally, higherBiﬁdobacterium, Lactobacillus, and SCFA production have been\nobserved by high pea-protein intake, which suppresses the secretion of inﬂammatory cytokines,\nIL-6 and TNF-↵, and improves interleukin-10 (IL-10) expression and glucose homeostasis [187–190].\nConversely, heterocyclic amines and glycan derived from red meat may promote inﬂammation in gut\nhealth due to higher concentration ofBacteroides and Fusobacterium and lower levels ofLactobacillus\nand Roseburia, which are also linked with lower anti-inﬂammatory responses and increased incidence\nof type 2 diabetes [191–193]. Accordingly, L-carnitine present in red meat can be metabolized to\ntrimethylamine oxide (TMAO), which is associated with an increased incidence of atherosclerosis [194]\nand obesity [195]. This may not be compatible, however, with studies yielding higher circulating\n\nNutrients 2020, 12, 2285 9 of 24\nTMAO following consumption of seafood and ﬁsh products, known to be cardio-protective, compared\nwith eggs and red meat proteins [196,197]. In addition, a high mixed whey–beef protein supplement for\n70 days given in endurance athletes, reducedRoseburia, Biﬁdobacterium longum, andBlautia and increased\nBacteroidetes species compared to the control group receiving maltodextrin [185]. However, in another\nstudy, high-protein beef supplementation in germ-free vs. unaltered microbiome mice depicted grip\nstrength improvement in both groups [198], questioning the e↵ects of high-protein beef administration\nin mice with di↵erent microbial composition. Likewise, the mice colonized with gut microbiota from\nolder adults with increased functionality displayed enhanced muscle strength, exhibiting a greater\nabundance of thePrevotellaceae family compared to the lower-functionality older-adult donors [198].\nMicrobiota transplants from pathogen-free mice have also shown reduced skeletal-muscle atrophy\nand mitochondria dysfunction markers than germ-free mice; more notably increased serum choline\nlevels and neuromuscular junction proteins, Rapsyn and Lrp4 [199]. Overall, white-meat protein\n(chicken, ﬁsh) demonstrates positive outcomes for the host vs. red-meat protein (beef, pork) due\nto increased abundance ofLactobacillus [200]. It is worth noting that, certain pro- and prebiotic\nproducts containBiﬁdobacterium and Lactobacillus species for their regulatory e↵ects on the microbiome,\nbone, and muscle health, which are crucial against frailty phenotypes in older individuals [201–203].\nInterestingly, favorable microbial composition has been displayed by plant proteins compared to white\nmeat and, to a greater extent, red meat proteins, partly due to a higher proportion of SCFA-producing\nbacteria. However, results should be treated with caution considering the lack of experimental human\nstudies [204–206]. Moreover, the variety of amino acids from di↵erent protein types available to the\nintestinal bacteria may regulate whole-body amino acid metabolism and protein utilization [207].\nMetabolism of serine, aspartame, and alanine are regulated in the small intestine by L-glutamine,\nwhile phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan are involved in species found inClostridium bartlettii,\nEubacterium hallii, andBacteroides [208,209]. In addition, lysine, glutamate, glycine, ornithine, aspartame,\nand threonine may contribute to acetate metabolism, whereas lysine, glutamate, and threonine to\nbutyrate synthesis [63,141]. This indicates that amino acids are crucial for SCFA synthesis showing\ngreat versatility regarding the production and synthesis of di↵erent SCFAs. Furthermore, delayed\nage-associated microbiota changes in mice have been observed by BCAA consumption, displaying\na greater abundance ofBiﬁdobacterium and Akkermansia [210], which improve glucose homeostasis and\ninsulin sensitivity [182,211,212]. Although beneﬁcial and deleterious e↵ects from protein consumption\nhave been identiﬁed, the health e↵ects of amino acids on the metabolic human phenotype interfered with\nthe gut microbiota that depend on protein digestibility and absorption are yet to be fully understood.\n4.3. Protein Utilization in the Gut: The Role of Dietary Fiber\nShort-chain fatty-acid production is primarily derived from non-digestible-carbohydrate\n(i.e., dietary ﬁber) consumption [213] during colonic bacterial fermentation [214]. These fermented\nproducts include acetate, propionate, and butyrate, approximately in a 60:20:20 ratio, respectively [215],\nand the two non-digestible carbohydrate categories are soluble (pectin, guar gum, psyllium, inulin)\nand insoluble ﬁber (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin) [216]. The recommended intake for dietary ﬁber is\ndeemed to be country-speciﬁc. For example, in the UK, the dietary target is settled at 30 g/day, while in\nAustralia it is at 28 g and 38 g for women and men, respectively. However, in both countries, the majority\nof the population does not meet the suggested ﬁber intake [217,218]. Dietary ﬁber may induce an array\nof metabolic e↵ects [219], including reduced systemic inﬂammation by regulating cytokine expression,\nprimarily interleukin-18, improved fat oxidation and insulin sensitivity [220–223]. The emerging role of\nSCFAs on skeletal-muscle metabolism and function was recently reviewed [224]. In addition, increased\nleucine levels are correlated with enhanced butyrate and propionate concentrations in pigs, displaying\na greater abundance of Actinobacteria species and body-fat loss [183]. This may indicate that the\nmicrobiome may play a pivotal role in mTOR activation and leucine metabolism in the intestinal\nepithelial cells, possessing a propitious role in metabolic health [86]. Likewise, amino acids, such as\ntryptophan, alanine, and phenylalanine may also impact satiety and gut motility through GLP-1,\n\nNutrients 2020, 12, 2285 10 of 24\nPYY, and serotonin modulation from the intestinal enteroendocrine L cells [225–231]. SCFAs may\nact as substrates in several tissues for GPCRs, stimulating GLP-1 and PYY release, delaying gastric\nemptying and reducing appetite and food intake [227,232,233]. Similarly, it has been shown that\npropionate attenuates reward-based eating behavior via striatal pathways [234], which are linked to\nhyperpalatable food consumption, known for its high-calorie content and association with obesogenic\nenvironments [235]. Hence, the potent anabolic e↵ects and peripherally appetite-induced responses of\nSCFAs and amino acids, particularly BCAAs, could reduce the risk of anabolic resistance in parallel\nwith greater adiposity, which are precursors of sarcopenic obesity.\nFurthermore, the inﬂuence of protein fermentation in the gut is primarily regulated by\nsubstrate utilization and transit time. It is suggested that the ratio of carbohydrates and protein\nconsumed impacts the protein utilized by the microbiome. Following a 2-week high-protein diet\n(1.5–2.2 g/kg/day) in older women, microbial composition remained unaltered in the absence of\nadded probiotic formulation [236]. The suppressed butyrate-producing populations ofRoseburia\nand Anaerostipes were lower than the probiotic added groups and no changes were seen regarding\nEubacterium and Ruminococcus, possibly due to the higher ﬁber intake of the plant-based products.\nAccordingly, a synbiotic-used probiotic component expressed increasedBiﬁdobacterium and Lactobacillus\nduring a weight-loss program containing a high-protein/low carbohydrate diet compared to the placebo\ngroup, indicating the potential requirement of probiotic supplementation for improved microbial\nrichness [237]. Moreover, high-protein/low-carbohydrate diets in obese subjects showed reduced\nbutyrate-producing bacteria and decreased levels ofRoseburia and Eubacterium rectale, displaying\na dose–response relationship, as carbohydrate intake was decreasing [148,238,239]. Likewise, decreased\nEubacterium rectaleand Biﬁdobacteria have been observed during weight-loss strategies in overweight and\nobese individuals in which further resistant-starch-carbohydrates reductions were common [240,241].\nAltered microbial composition by increasedBacteroides and Dorea and reducedFaecalibacterium\nspecies have also been reported in elite race walkers following a 2.2 g/kg/day diet containing\n<50 g carbohydrates, although their training and body composition status are confounding\nfactors [242]. In animals, decreased butyrate-producing bacteria fromRoseburia genera, Faecalibacterium,\nand Clostridium XIVa, as well as increased Firmicutes, have been conﬁrmed by high-protein consumption\nas opposed to moderate protein intakes [243,244]. The bacterial and metabolic e↵ects of high-protein\nand low-carbohydrate (low-CHO) diets in humans and animals are summarized in Table2.\nTable 2.

Therefore, recommendations\non the ratio and source of dietary protein [245] and carbohydrate consumption focusing on dietary\nﬁber would be pivotal for skeletal-muscle and metabolic health through the impact of the metabolites\ngenerated in the large and small intestine [160].\n5. Conclusions\nThe above sections illustrate the necessity of evaluating appropriate dietary components with the\ninclusion of both animal and plant-based food sources to optimize certain levels of gut microbiota\nspecies within high-protein diets. Regulating the quantity and source of food products may serve as\na critical component for the control of protein and carbohydrate-fermenting bacteria, which could\ngreatly inﬂuence various metabolic pathways. Given that di↵erent high-protein foods contain a varied\nmicro- and macronutrient proﬁle with notable distinctions among legumes, dairy, red and white meat,\nthe microbial environment responsible for beneﬁts and drawbacks in sarcopenic obesity cannot be\naccredited to a speciﬁc protein origin.\nConsequently, the amount and source of protein combined with other lifestyle factors need to be\ndeﬁned in regards to microbial diversity, which further supports a personalized overall macronutrient\napproach considering individual variation in microbial composition. Gender, ethnicity, medical history,\nmedication use, physical activity, genetics, local environment, and diet may all contribute signiﬁcantly to\ndi↵erent microbiota composition in older adults. Designing novel dietary patterns by examining these\nfactors carefully in relation to speciﬁc microbial species may lead to a reduced incidence of obesity and\nimprovements in skeletal-muscle-insulin sensitivity, as well as counteract sarcopenia and obesity during\nweight loss interventions using high-protein and ﬁber-rich diets. Therefore, biomarkers identifying\ndietary protein’s digestive capacity could aid older groups in monitoring their optimal daily protein\nintake and would minimise inappropriate amino acids reaching the colon and provide greater caloric\navailability for increased consumption of other vital macronutrients, such as dietary ﬁber, to optimize\ngut microbial eubiosis. Furthermore, fortiﬁcation of plant-based products with essential amino acids\nand the addition of host-protective bacteria in high-protein animal products (e.g., keﬁr) could provide\noptimal MPS synthesis and microbial diversity. However, the overall quality of foods and supplements,\nalongside their protein content should also be evaluated considering the gut microbial changes that\nmay occur throughout food processing. Moreover, the lack of long-term experimental human trials,\nmore e↵ective gene-sequencing methods for bacterial identiﬁcation, and microbial exploration in\nseveral organs of the gastrointestinal tract present challenges in predicting the appropriate timing\nduring which microbiome testing should be performed to identify microbiome changes occurring over\ntime. At present, more human studies investigating the microbiome of sarcopenic obese groups are\nwarranted. Focusing on the establishment and promotion of novel dietary protein and ﬁber RDAs,\n\nNutrients 2020, 12, 2285 12 of 24\nand aiming for greater BCFA and SCFA abundance, respectively, could provide various metabolic\nbeneﬁts in sarcopenic and obese individuals before we move towards a more personalized dietary\napproach through advanced microbiome metabolomic techniques.\nAuthor Contributions: K.P. conceived and wrote the initial draft of the manuscript; M.M.C., A.G., and D.S.\nreviewed and revised the manuscript.
