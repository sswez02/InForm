    "conclusions": "Oral creatine supplemen-\ntation combined with resistance training increases\nmaximal weight lifted in young men. There is no\nevidence for improved performance in older indi-\nviduals or women or for other types of strength\nand power exercises. Also, the safety of creatine\nremains unproven. Therefore, until these issues are\naddressed, its use cannot be universally recom-\nmended.\n■ KEY WORDS Creatine; dietary supplements;\nmeta-analysis. (J Fam Pract 2002; 51:945–952 )\nC\nreatine has gained widespread popularity during\nthe past decade as a possible performance-\nenhancing agent among professional and recreation-\nal athletes. It is the most widely used performance-\nenhancing supplement among youth aged 10 to 17\nyears,\n1 with 15% to 30% of high school athletes2,3 and\n48% of male Division I college athletes4 reporting cre-\natine use. Considered a nutritional supplement, it is\nnot regulated by the United States Food and Drug\nAdministration nor is it banned by the International\nOlympic Committee or National Collegiate Athletic\nAssociation. Because of the widespread use of crea-\ntine, primary care providers must be knowledgeable\nabout its effectiveness and safety.\nOral creatine monohydrate increases skeletal\nmuscle creatine concentration by 16% to 50%,\n5–7\nbut whether it is an effective ergogenic aid remains\ncontroversial. Multiple studies have investigated\nthis question, but many have been small, often\nincluding fewer than 10 subjects, and",
    "results": "have\nbeen conflicting.

    "methods": "Search strategy\nTo identify possible studies for inclusion, 1 author\n(M.F.M.) searched the MEDLINE electronic data-\nbase (1966–2000) using the terms “creatine supple-\nmentation” or “creatine” combined with “strength”\nor “power.” Another MEDLINE search (1966–2000)\nwas independently conducted by another author\n(R.L.D.) using the term “creatine not kinase” com-\nbined with a previously published search strategy\nto comprehensively identify randomized clinical\ntrials.\n15 We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials\nRegister using the term “creatine not kinase.” We\nmanually reviewed bibliographies of identified\nstudies, abstracts from American College of Sports\nMedicine annual meetings (1999 and 2000), and a\nreference list distributed by an expert on the sub-\nject at the annual meeting of the American Medical\nSociety for Sports Medicine (2000). Titles and avail-\nable abstracts were screened and relevant articles\nretrieved. An expert in the field was contacted for\nsources of unpublished data.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nTwo reviewers independently assessed articles for\ninclusion. A third reviewer was consulted to\nresolve discrepancies. We used the following inclu-\nsion criteria: (1) the articles reported results of ran-\ndomized or matched placebo-controlled trials\ninvestigating the effect of oral creatine supplemen-\ntation on strength or power with or without con-\ncomitant resistance training; (2) the study subjects\nwere healthy men or women older than 16 years\nwith or without previous athletic training; and (3)\nthe studies were published in any language. Given\nthe general disagreement regarding the time\nrequired for muscle creatine concentration to\nreturn to presupplementation levels after discon-\ntinuing oral creatine,\n16–18 studies using a crossover\ndesign were excluded from the statistical analysis\nunless data from the first arm, before crossover,\ncould be abstracted or obtained from the original\ninvestigator. Outcomes were measures of strength\nor power of any muscle group, including maximal\nweight lifted; peak power achieved in maximal\n(sprint) cycle ergometry; and peak knee\nflexion/extension torque in isokinetic dynamome-\nter testing. Measurements of endurance, such as\ntime to fatigue on cycle ergometer and number of\nrepetitions achieved in submaximal weight lifting,\nwere excluded. For studies reporting outcome per\nkilogram of body weight, we contacted investiga-\ntors to obtain absolute outcome values and exclud-\ned studies if uncorrected data were not received.\nWe also excluded articles that evaluated outcomes\nnot investigated in at least 2 other studies. Finally,\nif we could not extract data in a usable form, we\ncontacted investigators to obtain adequate data.\nQuality assessment\nTwo independent reviewers appraised articles to\ndetermine methodological quality with respect to\nrisk of bias under the following categories: method\nof randomization, allocation concealment, blind-\ning, similarity of study groups, withdrawals and\ndropouts, and intention-to-treat analysis. Each\nstudy that met inclusion criteria was given a quali-\nty score, with a maximum possible score of 10,\nusing a tool adapted from the Cochrane\nHandbook.\n19 The quality assessment data are pre-\nsented but were not used to exclude or rank any\nstudy.\nData abstraction and statistical analysis\nTwo independent reviewers abstracted data, and a\nthird reviewer resolved differences. For studies\ninvestigating multiple sprints, data from the first\nsprint only were included in statistical analysis\nbecause the first sprint is when peak power\nachievement is expected. A weighted mean differ-\nence (WMD) between creatine and placebo groups\nwas calculated for each outcome using Review\nManager 4.1 software (developed by The Cochrane\nCollaboration). A fixed effects model was used\nunless statistical heterogeneity was significant (P <\n.05), in which case a random effects model was\nused. Subanalyses were planned on several factors\nthat were anticipated to be sources for variation,\nincluding (1) dose and duration of creatine admin-\nistration, (2) concomitant resistance training, (3)\ndifferent baseline level of physical training, (4) age,\nand (5) sex.\nRESUL TS\nDescription of studies\nAfter reviewing titles and available abstracts of\nmore than 500 articles, we retrieved 66 potentially\nrelevant studies, 16 of which met inclusion criteria\nfor the analysis.\n17,20–34 Characteristics of these stud-\nies are summarized in the Table. Included studies\nrepresented 20 discrete samples and 414 subjects.\nTwo studies\n20,21 evaluated creatine supplementa-\ntion in men older than 60 years, whereas all the\nothers studied younger subjects (range, 18–36\nyears). Only 1 study included women.\n17 Creatine\ndosages were similar across included studies (typ-\nically 20 g/d for the first 4–7 days of supplemen-\ntation and 5 g/d thereafter). Studies that evaluated\nmaximal weight lifting performance were more\nlikely to include adjuvant resistance training pro-\ngrams in their protocols than those that evaluated\ncycle ergometry sprint or isokinetic dynamometer\n| ORIGINAL RESEARCH |\n946 ■ The Journal of Family Practice • NOVEMBER 2002 • VOL. 51, NO. 11\n\nperformance. None included cycle ergometry\ntraining.\nMethodological quality \nof included studies\nThe methodological quality of studies was general-\nly low (Table). The mean quality score was 3.5 ±\n1.2 (mean ± SD) out of a possible 10 (range,\n2–5.5). None of the studies identified the method\nof randomization used or specifically reported an\nintention-to-treat analysis. None specifically report-\ned masking of outcome assessment. In general,\nthese significant flaws in study design would tend\nto result in overestimation of the benefit of creatine\nsupplementation.\nAbsolute strength\nWhen 1- to 3-repetition maximum bench press\nstrength measurements were statistically combined\n(they were homogeneous), the creatine supple-\nmentation group showed an absolute strength\nincrease of 6.85 kg (95% confidence interval [CI],\n5.24–8.47; n = 143) lifted per repetition greater than\nthat seen with placebo alone (Figure 1). There was\nno additional advantage in strength performance\nafter 9 to 12 weeks of supplementation (WMD = 6.6\nkg; 95% CI, 3.5–9.5) compared with 4 to 8 weeks of\nsupplementation (WMD = 6.6 kg; 95% CI, 4.8–8.4).\nSubanalysis for an interaction with resistance train-\ning, previous training level, age, or sex was not\npossible because all studies measuring bench press\nstrength except one\n17 investigated creatine supple-\n| DOES ORAL CREATINE SUPPLEMENTATION IMPROVE STRENGTH? |\nThe Journal of Family Practice • NOVEMBER 2002 • VOL. 51, NO. 11 ■ 947\nCharacteristics of included studies\nComparability \nWeight of creatine \nNo. training Quality & placebo \nsubjects Dose per day during Outcome score groups \nReference (sex) and duration Training level study? measurement (out of 10) at baseline*\nBarnett 1996 17 (M) 280 mg/kg /H110034 d Active No CP 2.5 +\nCooke 1995 12 (M) 20 g /H110035 d Untrained No CP 2.5 +\nCooke 1997† 80 (M) 20 g /H110035 d Trained or active No CP 2 +++\nDawson 1995‡ 18 (M), 20 g /H110035 d Active No CP 3 +++\n22 (M)\nJones 1999 16 (M) 20 g /H110035 d then Trained Yes CM 3 +++\n5 g /H1100310 wk\nStone 1999 20 (M) 0.22 g/kg /H1100335 d Trained Yes CM, BP , S 4.5 +++\nKelly 1998 18 (M) 20 g /H110035 d then Trained Yes 3BP 2 /H11002\n5 g /H1100326 d\nNoonan 1998 39 (M) 20 g /H110035 d then Trained Yes BP 5.5 +++\n300 mg/kg /H110038 wk\nPeeters 1999 35 (M) 20 g /H110033 d then Trained Yes BP 3 +++\n10 g /H110036 wk\nVandenberghe 1997 19 (F) 20 g /H110034 d then Untrained Yes BP , S 5 +++\n5 g /H1100310 wk\nPearson 1999 16 (M) 5 g /H1100310 wk Trained Yes BP , S, PT 3 +++\nVolek 1999 19 (M) 25 g /H110037 d then Trained Yes BP , S 4.5 +++\n5 g /H1100312 wk\nGilliam 2000 23 (M) 20 g /H110035 d Active but No PT 2.5 +\nuntrained\nRawson 1999§ 20 (M) 20 g /H1100310 d then Untrained No AF, PT 4.5 +++\n4 g /H1100320 d\nRawson 2000§ 17 (M) 20 g /H110035 d Untrained No AF 3.5 +++\nBecque 2000 23 (M) 20 g /H110035 d then Trained Yes AF 5 +\n2 g /H110036 wk\n*Comparability between groups was assessed for age, anthropomorphic measurements, and strength outcomes. +++ = similar for al l 3 characteristics; + = similar\nfor strength outcome measurements; /H11002= not comparable at baseline for strength outcome.\n†Four protocols with 20 subjects each evaluating the same strength outcome measurement reported in Cooke 1997.\n‡Two separate experiments reported in Dawson 1995.\n§ Included subjects > 60 years old; in all others subjects were < 36 years old.\nAF, 1 repetition maximum arm flexor strength; BP , 1 repetition maximum bench press strength; 3BP , 3 repetition maximum bench press strength; CM, cycle ergome-\nter mean peak power; CP , cycle ergometer peak power; PT, isokinetic leg flexion/extension peak torque; S, 1 repetition maximum squat strength.\nTABLE \n\nmentation in previously trained young men who\ncontinued resistance training during supplementa-\ntion. The 1 study in previously sedentary young\nwomen\n17 did find a trend toward increased bench\npress strength, although independently this change\nwas not statistically significant.\nThere was no significant difference in 1-repeti-\ntion maximum arm flexor strength with creatine\nsupplementation (WMD = 1.53 kg; 95% CI, /H110021.07\nto 4.13; n = 60; Figure 2). However, 2 trials\n20,21 of\nthe 3 evaluating this outcome studied subjects\nolder than 60 years and did not employ adjuvant\nweight training programs. The study that incorpo-\nrated resistance training and evaluated younger\nsubjects\n22 found a modest (29.9% vs 16.5%)\nimprovement in 1-repetition maximum arm flexor\nstrength with creatine compared with placebo.\nFor 1-repetition maximum squat, creatine sup-\nplementation resulted in a strength increase of 9.76\nkg (95% CI, 3.37–16.15; n = 74) greater than that of\nplacebo (Figure 3). There was no advantage to\nlonger-term supplementation (10.9 kg more than\nplacebo [95% CI, 3.4–18.4] for 5–6 weeks com-\npared with 10.4 kg [95% CI, 3.5–17.2] for 10–12\nweeks). Again, in all but 1 study\n17 measuring squat\nperformance, subjects were previously trained\nyoung men engaging in adjuvant resistance train-\ning programs, so subanalysis for other variables\nwas not possible. For previously sedentary\nwomen, Vandenberghe et al\n17 found no difference\nat 5 weeks, but they did find a significant improve-\nment in 1-repetition maximum squat performance\n| ORIGINAL RESEARCH |\n948 ■ The Journal of Family Practice • NOVEMBER 2002 • VOL. 51, NO. 11\nStudies assessing 1- to 3-repetition maximum bench press strength\nFIGURE 1 \nCreatine Placebo\nMean change Mean change WMD between creatine \nin wt lifted, in wt lifted, and placebo groups Weight, \nStudy n kg (SD) n kg (SD) (95% CI fixed) % WMD, kg (95% CI)\nKelly 9 8.90 (3.30) 9 2.50 (0.01) ■ 56 6.40 (4.24–8.56)\nNoonan 13 8.90 (14.08) 13 1.70 (8.40) ■ 3.3 7.20 (–1.71 to 16.11)\nPearson 8 5.10 (5.34) 8 –1.6 (11.31) ■ 3.5 6.71 (–1.96 to 15.38)\nPeeters 11 11.17 (5.51) 14 0.87 (7.66) 9.7 10.30 (5.12–15.48)\nStone 9 12.40 (8.26) 11 5.00 (7.96) ■ 5.1 7.40 (0.24–14.56)\nVandenberghe 10 12.00 (2.56) 9 6.00 (5.33) ■ 17.8 6.00 (2.17–9.83)\nVolek 1999 10 22.60 (8.22) 9 15.00 (8.40) ■ 4.6 7.60 (0.11–15.09)\nTotal 70 73 ◆ 100.0 6.85 (5.24–8.47)\n–10 –5 0 5 10\nFavors Placebo Favors Creatine\nSolid boxes represent the WMD in mean change in weight lifted (kg) between creatine and placebo groups.

The summa-\nry weighted mean difference of 16.79 W (95% CI,\n/H1100213.26 to 46.84; n = 149) was insignificant, both\nstatistically (test for overall effect P = .3) and clini-\ncally, because this represents approximately a 1%\nchange greater than baseline. Two studies\n23,24\nlooked at mean peak power across a series of 15-\nto 30-second sprints and found inconsistent results,\nwith a summary weighted mean difference of 68.61\nW (95% CI, /H1100285.74 to 222.97; n = 36).

One\nstudy\n26 reported average peak torque across 30 iso-\nkinetic leg flexion/extension contractions; 1 study21\nreported the sum of peak torque across 5 sets of 30\nisokinetic leg flexion/extension contractions; and 1\nstudy\n27 gave peak torque data for isokinetic leg\nextension but did not describe precisely how peak\ntorque was determined. There was no difference\nbetween creatine and placebo for isokinetic leg\nflexion/extension peak torque using a standardized\nmean difference to account for variations in meas-\nurement of this outcome. Tests for heterogeneity\nwere nonsignificant for this outcome (P = .19).\nAdverse effects\nFour studies commented on short-term adverse\neffects of creatine supplementation. Three stud-\nies\n17,23,28 found no difference between creatine and\nplacebo. One study 21 reported gastrointestinal\nupset, rash, or headache in 3 subjects taking crea-\ntine and no adverse effects in subjects taking\nplacebo. None of these studies was designed to\nevaluate long-term adverse effects of creatine sup-\nplementation, and there were no reports of longer-\nterm follow up.",
    "discussion": "This is the first study to report quantitatively the\neffect of creatine supplementation on strength per-\nformance from meta-analysis of the existing litera-\nture. We found that oral creatine supplementation\nimproves maximal resistance exercise performance\nin previously trained young men. There is insuffi-\ncient evidence that creatine improves other meas-\nures of strength, such as cycle ergometry sprint\npeak power or isokinetic dynamometer peak\ntorque, or that creatine improves strength in\nwomen or older individuals. The effect of creatine\non endurance, submaximal exercise, or actual “on-\nfield” athletic performance was not addressed.\nCreatine’s ergogenic properties may result from\nallowing increased work during training and\ndecreasing recovery time. If so, creatine must be\ncombined with adjuvant training to increase\nstrength and power. Only studies investigating\nmaximal weight-lifting performance incorporated\nresistance-training programs specific to the out-\ncome being measured. Three studies included\nweight training but investigated non–weight-lifting\noutcomes,\n23,24,27 and only 1 study 24 found a benefit\nfrom creatine supplementation. It is unclear\nwhether the lack of effect for non–weight-lifting\noutcomes means that creatine is not beneficial\nunless combined with specific adjuvant training or\nthat creatine simply is not ergogenic for outcomes\nother than maximal weight lifted.\nThis meta-analysis has some limitations. Our\ndefinition of strength included only “pure strength”\nor “power” measurements to allow statistical com-\nparisons between similar outcomes. Because mus-\ncle strength is related to muscle endurance,\nresearchers may define strength differently. It is not\nobvious at what point an exercise becomes a test\nof endurance and not just strength, but there is a\nphysiologic basis for believing that creatine sup-\nplementation would more markedly improve per-\nformance in maximal or shorter duration exercises\n(ie, requiring strength and not endurance). The\ninclusion criteria for this project were determined\nbefore study review and selection and were\napplied consistently across all studies.\nThe quality and design of identified studies was\nanother limitation. Most were small and did not\nfully delineate their randomization or blinding\nstrategies. Multiple variations in study protocols\nmade combining results of different studies some-\nwhat problematic. Unfortunately, meta-regression\nor subanalysis for variables such as concurrent\nresistance training, previous training level, age, and\nsex were not possible because too few studies\nevaluated these variables independently of one\nanother. Almost all of the studies finding a benefit\nof creatine supplementation were in young, previ-\nously trained men who engaged in resistance train-\ning concomitantly with supplementation, and the\noutcome measured was maximal weight lifted.\nThose studies not finding a difference were gener-\nally of less highly trained or older individuals, did\nnot include resistance training, and more often\ninvestigated outcomes other than maximal weight\nlifted. This meta-analysis identifies that it is impos-\nsible to conclude from the existing literature which\ncombination of variables is necessary to see a ben-\nefit of creatine supplementation.\n| ORIGINAL RESEARCH |\n950 ■ The Journal of Family Practice • NOVEMBER 2002 • VOL. 51, NO. 11\n\nMore information is needed on the safety of cre-\natine supplementation.

Additionally, the designs of these\nstudies precluded the possibility of detecting seri-\nous adverse effects such as death or disability.\nThere have been case reports of renal dysfunction\ndue to creatine\n38–40 and, as of 1998, the Food and\nDrug Administration had received 32 adverse event\nreports including seizures, myopathy, rhabdomy-\nolosis, cardiac arrhythmia, and death.\n41\nGiven the popularity of nutritional supplements\namong all levels of athletes, clinicians cannot avoid\nquestions about the effectiveness and safety of cre-\natine supplementation. This meta-analysis demon-\nstrated that oral creatine does improve perform-\nance during maximal resistance exercises in young\nmen. However, we found no benefit for outcomes\nother than maximal weight lifted, suggesting that\ncreatine may not improve actual performance in\nmore complex movements requiring strength,\nspeed, and coordination of multiple muscle\ngroups. Studies investigating the effect of creatine\nin actual athletic performance are lacking.\nSeveral important questions remain to be\nanswered about creatine. What are the effects for\nwomen and older individuals? Is resistance training\nnecessary to see strength performance improve-\nment? Are these improvements in strength accom-\npanied by improved athletic performance? How\nlong do the effects of creatine remain after discon-\ntinuing supplementation? Most importantly, what is\nthe long-term safety profile of creatine? Without\nfurther research to answer these questions, we can-\nnot support the use of creatine supplementation\nfor performance enhancement despite evidence for\na positive impact on some components of strength.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study was supported in part by a\nFaculty Development in Family Medicine Grant (No. 5D45 PE 55052-\n09) and a National Research Service Award Grant (No. 1T32 PE\n10030-03) from the United States Department of Health and Human\nServices.
