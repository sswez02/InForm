Inclusion criteria were adult participants (≥18 5 \nyears); creatine provided before and/or after exercise versus a non- creatine comparator; 6 \nmeasurement of muscle function recovery, muscle soreness, inflammation, myocellular 7 \nprotein efflux, oxidative stress; range of motion (ROM); randomized controlled trials in 8 \nhumans. Thirteen studies (totalling 278 participants; 235 males, 43 females; age range 20 9 \nto 60 years), were deemed eligible for analysis.

    "introduction": "25 \nUnaccustomed or strenuous exercise encompassing high force eccentric (i.e., 26 \nlengthening) muscle contractions can cause ultrastructural damage to skeletal muscle , 27 \nwhich is typically referred to as exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) (Hyldahl & 28 \nHubal, 2013). Symptoms of EIMD include impaired force-generating capacity, delayed 29 \nonset muscle soreness (DOMS), efflux of myocellular proteins (e.g., creatine kinase 30 \n[CK]), swelling of the affected limb, and restricted range of motion (ROM) (Ebbeling & 31 \nClarkson, 1989; Hyldahl & Hubal, 2013; Mackey & Kjaer, 2017; Owens, Twist, Cobley, 32 \nHowatson, & Close, 2018). These symptoms, especially the increase in muscle soreness 33 \nand t ransient loss of muscle function, can impair subsequent performance (Doma, 34 \nDeakin, & Bentley, 2017) and increase the risk of injury (Barnett, 2006; Cheung Hume, 35 \n& Maxwell, 2003). Consequently, athletes requiring rapid recovery between strenuous 36 \nbouts of exercise (e.g., soccer and basketball players) , often use interventions to lessen 37 \nthe symptoms of EIMD. 38 \n 39 \nCreatine, a non-essential nutrient mostly stored in muscle, is a popular dietary ergogenic 40 \naid, and while more often studied for its effects on performa nce (Buford et al., 2007), 41 \nsome propose it may enhance recovery from exercise by attenuating markers of EIMD 42 \n(Bassit et al., 2010; Cooke, Rybalka, Williams, Cribb, & Hayes, 2009; Deminice, Rosa, 43 \nFranco, Jordao, & de Freitas, 2013; Rosene et al., 2009; Veggi et al., 2013; Wang, Fang, 44 \nLee, Yang, & Chan, 2018). How supplemental creatine might attenuate EIMD is not well 45 \nunderstood but several mechanisms have been proposed. Increasing muscle 46 \nphosphocreatine stores (achievable with 5 days of creatine ingestion; Harris, Söderlund, 47 \n& Hultman, 1992), is suggested to preserve intramuscular Ca2+ homeostasis (Minaieva, 48 \n\n3 \n \nVentura-Clapier, & Veksler, 1996), stabilize the muscle membrane and reduce fluidity 49 \n(Saks & Strumia, 1993) , attenuate inflammation (Bassit, Curi, & Costa Rosa, 2008; 50 \nSantos, Bassit, Caperuto, & Costa Rosa, 2004) and lessen free radical mediated damage 51 \n(Basta, Stejnborn, & Szczesniak, 2006; Rahimi, 2011; Young et al. 2010; Sestili 2006) . 52 \nGiven that inflammation and oxidative stress (an imbalance in free radical generation and 53 \nclearance, in favour of the former [(Powers, Nelson, & Hudson, 2011)]) are implicated in 54 \nmuscle injury, reducing their activity might attenuate EIMD (Owens et al., 2019; Tidball, 55 \n2005). Creatine supplementation may also increase satellite cell number and myonuclear 56 \ncontent (Olsten et al., 2006), which play critical roles in muscle fibre regeneration 57 \nfollowing exercise (Owens et al., 2018). 58 \n 59 \nNonetheless, studies examining the effects of creatine supplementation on EIMD have 60 \nproduced equivocal findings ; some report beneficial effects on biological markers of 61 \nrecovery such as CK , lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or i nflammation (Bassit, Curi, & 62 \nCosta Rosa, 2008; Reinaldo Abunasser Bassit et al., 2010; Basta, Skarpańska-Stejnborn, 63 \n& Pilaczyńska- Szcześniak, 2006; Cooke, Rybalka, Williams, Cribb, & Hayes, 2009; 64 \nSantos, Bassit, Caperuto, & Costa Rosa, 2004; Veggi et al., 2013; Wang, F ang, Lee, 65 \nYang, & Chan, 2018), or functional markers of recovery such as strength (Cooke et al., 66 \n2009; Rosene et al., 2009), ROM (Veggi et al., 2013) and muscle soreness (Veggi et al., 67 \n2013). Yet several studies have found no benefit of creati ne supplementation on 68 \nbiological (Machado, Pereira, Sampaio-Jorge, Knifis, & Hackney, 2009; Rawson, Gunn, 69 \n& Clarkson, 2001; Rawson, Conti, & Miles, 2007; Taylor, Panza, Ballard, White, & 70 \nThompson, 2018) or functional markers of recovery (Boychuk et al., 2016; McKinnon, 71 \nGraham, & Tiidus, 2012; Rawson et al., 2001; Rawson et al., 2007; Taylor et al., 2018). 72 \n\n4 \n \nMany recent reviews have attempted to form a consensus on creatine ’s efficacy as a 73 \nrecovery aid by summarising the findings of individual studies, but none performed a 74 \nsystematic review or meta -analysis (Rawson, Clarkson, & Tarnopolsky, 2017; Harty, 75 \nCottet, Malloy, & Kerksick, 2019; Kim et al., 2015). A recent systematic review 76 \nexamined whether combining creatine with β -hydroxy β -methylbutyrate (HMB) 77 \nattenuates markers of post-exercise recovery and they reported no benefits (Fernández-78 \nLanda et al., 2019) . However, they did not analyse the effects of creatine alone, which 79 \nmeant few studies were included in their analysis (n = 4). Therefore, the aim of this study 80 \nwas to perform a systematic review and meta -analysis of randomised controlled trials 81 \nexamining whether creatine supplementation attenuates markers of EIMD following 82 \nexercise and is thus an efficacious recovery aid for athletes. 83 \n 84",
    "methods": "85 \nThis review was conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items 86 \nfor Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Moher, Liberati, 87 \nTetzlaff, & Altman, 2009 ). The study protocol was pre-registered in the International 88 \nProspective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database (registration 89 \nnumber: CRD42020178735). 90 \n 91 \nSearch strategy 92 \nMedline and SPORTDiscus were searched from inception until April 8th, 2020 (Figure 1) 93 \nand no language restrictions were applied (although full-text texts not available in English 94 \nwere excluded). The search terms are shown in the Online Supplementary material. After 95 \ndeleting duplicates, both authors independently screened the title s and abstracts of 96 \n\n5 \n \nretrieved articles using predefined eligibility criteria, as per a Population, Intervention, 97 \nComparator, Outcome, Study design (PICOS) framework (see Online Supplementary 98 \nmaterial). A manual search of reference lists from the included articles was also 99 \nperformed. Full texts of relevant articles were retrieved and assessed for eligibility by 100 \nboth authors independently. Both authors agreed on the final studies to be included — in 101 \nthe event of any disagreements, the senior author (TC) made the final decision. 102 \n 103 \nStudy selection 104 \nThe following inclusion criteria were used to assess the eligibility of retrieved articles: 105 \n(1) studies with adult human participants (≥18 years); (2) studies providing information 106 \non the timing, frequency, dose, and duration of creatine supplementation pre and/or post-107 \nany type of acute exercise; (3) studies including a comparator group that consumed an 108 \ninert placebo, or a product that contains no creatine at the same time -points; (4) studies 109 \nreporting acute post-exercise (up to 168 h) changes in muscle strength recovery, muscle 110 \nsoreness, myocellular proteins , oxidative stress, inflammation and/or ROM as an 111 \noutcome, regardless of measurement/equipment used; (5) randomized controlled t rials 112 \nperformed in humans (no exclusion criteria were applied for study design, or blinding). 113 \nStudies were excluded if they administered multiple supplements. 114 \n 115 \nData extraction 116 \nRelevant information was extracted and tabulated into a Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet by 117 \nthe first author and validated by the second author. The data extraction sheet was adapted 118 \nform an example provided by the Introduction to Systematic Reviews Course at York 119 \nUniversity, UK, and has previously been used to extract similar data (Clifford, Jeffries, 120 \n\n6 \n \nStevenson, & Davies, 2019). Collected data included: (1) authors and year of publication; 121 \n(2) study design (e.g., double blind, parallel or crossover); (3) participant characteristics 122 \n(age, male/female ratio ); (4) supplementation protocol (timing, frequency, dose, 123 \nduration); (5) exercise protocol (type, duration, repetitions, sets); (6) sample size; and (7) 124 \nrelevant outcome measures. Eligible outcomes were any of the following taken <168 h 125 \npost-exercise: muscle strength/function; muscle soreness/pain; creatine kinase; 126 \nmyoglobin; lactate dehydrogenase; inflammation (any marker); oxidative stress (any 127 \nmarker); range of motion. 128 \n 129 \nFor each outcome measure, t he baseline and follow -up data were extracted as mean ± 130 \nstandard deviation (SD). If follow-up data was not available these were requested from 131 \ncorresponding authors or extrapolated from figures using WebPlotDigitizer ( n = 12 132 \nstudies). This software is shown to have high levels of intercoder reliability and validity 133 \n(Drevon, Fursa, & Malcolm, 2016). None of the contacted authors provided the requested 134 \ndata. One study (Rosene et al., 2009) was excluded from the systematic review as no 135 \ngroup differences were p resented, while another study (Rawson et al., 2001) had to be 136 \nexcluded from the muscle soreness meta- analysis because the numerical data required 137 \nwas not reported. Additionally, the muscle strength data from two studies (Cooke et al., 138 \n2009; McKinnon et al., 2012) had to be extracted as mean change from baseline, rather 139 \nthan follow-up, and the data from one study had to be extracted as log-transformed, rather 140 \nthan un-transformed data, for two outcomes (CK, C-reactive protein [CRP]) (Rawson et 141 \nal., 2007). 142 \n 143 \n 144 \n\n7 \n \nQuality assessment 145 \nStudy quality was assessed by both authors independently using the Cochrane 146 \nCollaborations risk of bias tool ( Higgins et al., 2011).

    "discussion": ". Risk of bias for e ach study was assessed for the following domains: 148 \n(1) random sequence generation (selection bias) ; (2) allocation concealment (selection 149 \nbias); (3) blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) ; (4) blinding of 150 \noutcome assessment (detection bias) ; (5) incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) ; (6) 151 \nselective reporting (reporting bias); and (7) other sources of bias (other bias). 152 \n 153 \nData analysis 154 \nData were described narratively and are presented in tables (Table 1 and 2). If an outcome 155 \nhad been measured in ≥ 2 studies at the same time -point, we conducted a meta-analysis 156 \nusing Review Manager version 5.4 (The Cochrane Collaboration, UK) and presented the 157 \ndata as f orest plots. As the continuous outcomes (muscle strength, muscle soreness, 158 \nmyocellular markers [CK, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)], inflammation [CRP, 159 \nprostaglandin E 2 (PGE2), tumor necrosis factor -α (TNF α)], ROM) were pooled on 160 \ndifferent scales, standardi zed mean differences (SMD s) and 95% confidence intervals 161 \n(CIs) were calculated .

    "results": "162 \nwere presented in five subcategories based on most frequent follow -up time s (<30 163 \nminutes, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours post-exercise). We expected at least some degree of 164 \nheterogeneity given the vari ation in exercise, dose and participants in each study and 165 \ntherefore applied r andom-effect models. To avoid w ithin-study effect size multiplicity 166 \n(López-López, Page, Lipsey, & Higgins, 2018) , we selected one outcome per study for 167 \nour meta-analysis.

Nonetheless, we conducted sensitivity analyses 224 \nto assess whether removing the mean change and log-transformed data from the analyses 225 \n(described above) resulted in any meaningful changes in the overall effect sizes. This was 226 \nnot pre-specified. 227 \n 228 \nPublication bias and heterogeneity assessment 229 \nFunnel plots were used to evaluate publication bias (see Figures 4S and 5S). The 24-hour 230 \nanalysis for muscle soreness and CK were used to inspect publication bias as these had 231 \nthe largest number of studies. Because tests for funnel plot asymmetry are not 232 \nrecommended when a meta-analysis contains fewer than 10 studies — due to the power 233 \nbeing too low to distinguish chance from real asymmetry (Page, Higgins, & Sterne, 2019), 234 \nthese plots should be interpreted cautiously. Heterogeneity was assessed with the Chi 2 235 \nand I2 statistic (see Figures 2-6). The level of significance for the Chi2 test was P > 0.10. 236 \nI2 values of 25, 50 and 75% were interpreted as low, moderate and high heterogeneity, 237 \nrespectively (Higgins, 2003). 238 \n 239 \nResults 240 \nSearch results 241 \nWe retrieved 464 articles , which was reduced to 424 once duplicates were removed 242 \n(Figure 1). After the initial screening of abstracts and titles, 408 articles were excluded. 243 \nTwo additional studies were identified through the manual search of retrieved full -text 244 \n\n15 \n \n15 \n \narticles (Bassit et al., 2010; Machado et al., 2009); overall, eighteen full-text articles were 245 \nidentified for further assessment (Bassit et al., 2008; Bassit et al., 2010; Basta et al., 2006; 246 \nBoychuk et al., 2016; Burke, Smith-Palmer, Holt, Head, & Chilibeck, 2001; Cooke et al., 247 \n2009; Deminice , Rosa, Franco, Jordao, & de Freitas, 2013; Machado et al., 2009; 248 \nMcKinnon et al., 2012; Rawson et al., 2001; Rawson et al., 2007; Rosene et al., 2009; 249 \nSantos et al., 2004; Silva et al., 2013; Taylor et al., 2018; Veggi et al., 2013; Volek et al., 250 \n2004; Wang et al., 2018). Of these, five were excluded (Burke et al., 2001; Deminice et 251 \nal., 2013; Rosene et al., 2009; Silva et al., 2013; Volek et al., 2004) for various reasons 252 \n(see Figure 1) and thirteen were deemed eligible for the systematic review and meta-253 \nanalysis (Figure 1, Tables 1 and 2). 254 \n 255 \nStudy characteristics 256 \nThe participant and intervention characteristics of the included studies are summarized in 257 \nTable 1. The creatine and placebo groups consisted of 142 and 136 participants, 258 \nrespectively. The mean age of the two groups was the same (27 years), ranging from 20 259 \nto 60 years. E ight studies recruited untrained participants (Boychuk et al., 2016; Cooke 260 \net al., 2009; Machado et al., 2009; McKinnon et al., 2012; Rawson et al. 2001; Taylor et 261 \nal., 2018; Veggi et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2018) , three were conducted on trained 262 \nparticipants (endurance-trained; [Bassit et al., 2008; San tos et al., 2004], resistance -263 \ntrained; [Rawson et al., 2007]), and two on highly trained elite athletes (rowers [Basta et 264 \nal., 2006], ironman athletes [Bassit et al., 2010]). 265 \n 266 \nAll thirteen studies used a randomised, placebo- controlled parallel group design. Four 267 \nstudies administered creatine based on the individual’s body mass; 0.3 g·kg BM·d -1 268 \n\n16 \n \n16 \n \n(Boychuk et al., 2016; Cooke et al., 2009; Machado et al., 2009; Rawson et al., 2007) , 269 \nwhereas an absolute dose was provided in the remaining nine studies (see Table 1); of 270 \nthese, eight studies used a daily dose of 20 g, while one study administered 10 g·d -1 271 \n(Taylor et al., 2018). The most common loading duration was 5-6 days. The frequency of 272 \ndaily loading varied between one and four times; however, the loading dose was most 273 \nfrequently divided into 3-4 times per day. Five studies (Basta et al., 2006; Cooke et al., 274 \n2009; McKinnon et al., 2012; Rawson et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2018) implemented a 275 \nmaintenance dose, ranging from 0.03 to 0.1 g·kg BM·d -1 and 2 to 10 g·d -1. Participants 276 \nwere supplemented for a total of 5 to 35 days. 277 \n 278 \nAll eligible studies supplemented creatine prior to the muscle damage protocol; however, 279 \nfour studies (Boychuk et al., 2016; Cooke et al., 2009; McKinnon et al., 2012; Rawson et 280 \nal., 2007) also administered creatine during recovery from the exercise bout. 281 \nAdditionally, nine studies co-ingested creatine alongside carbohydrates, either matching 282 \nthe dose of creatine (Machado et al., 2009; McKinnon et al., 2012; Veggi et al., 2013; 283 \nWang et al., 2018) or consuming a greater dose of carbohydrate to creatine (Bassit et al., 284 \n2008; Bassit et al., 2010; Cooke et al., 2009; Rawson et al., 2001; Santos et al., 2004); the 285 \nremaining four studies ingested creatine in isolation. 286 \n 287 \nA variety of exercise protocols were employed to induce muscle damage (Table 2), with 288 \nthe most common being resistance exercise (Machado et al., 2009; Rawson et al., 2007; 289 \nVeggi et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2018), eccentric muscle contractions (Boychuk et al., 290 \n2016; Cooke et al., 2009; McKinnon et al., 2012; Rawson et al., 2001), and long-distance 291 \nrunning (Bassit et al., 2008; Bassit et al., 2010; Santos et al., 2004). 292 \n\n17 \n \n17 \n \nMeta-analysis 293 \nMuscle strength 294 \nFive studies (Boychuk et al., 2016; Cooke et al., 2009; McKinnon et al., 2012; Rawson 295 \net al., 2001; Rawson et al., 2007) presented data on muscle strength (Figure 2). Creatine 296 \nsupplementation did not accelerate the recovery of muscle strength at <30 minute s, 24 297 \nhours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and 96 hours post-exercise. High heterogeneity was identified 298 \nat 24 and 96 hours post-exercise. 299 \n 300 \nMuscle soreness 301 \nMuscle soreness was measured by five studies (Boychuk et al., 2016; McKinnon et al., 302 \n2012; Rawson et al., 2007; Taylor et al., 2018; Veggi et al., 2013) (Figure 3). Creatine 303 \nsupplementation did not reduce muscle soreness at <30 min, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 304 \nand 96 hours post-exercise. At all follow -up times, significant heterogeneity was 305 \nidentified (Figure 3). 306 \n 307 \nCreatine kinase 308 \nNine studies (Basta et al., 2006; Bassit et al., 2010; Cooke et al., 2009; Machado et al., 309 \n2009; Rawson et al., 2001; Rawson et al., 2007; Santos et al., 2004; Taylor et al., 2018; 310 \nWang et al., 2018) measured CK activity (Figure 4). There were no differences at <30 311 \nmin and 24 hours post-exercise but at 48 hours post-exercise CK activity was lower with 312 \ncreatine — although significant heterogeneity was identified. No differences were found 313 \nat 72 hours and 96 hours post-exercise, with significant heterogeneity identified at 72 314 \nhours and 96 hours. 315 \n 316 \n\n18 \n \n18 \n \nLactate dehydrogenase 317 \nFive studies (Bassit et al., 2010; Cooke et al., 2009; Rawson et al., 2001; Rawson et al., 318 \n2007; Santos et al., 2004) measured LDH levels (Figure 5). Creatine supplementation did 319 \nnot attenuate LDH at <30 min, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and 96 hours post-exercise. 320 \n 321 \nROM 322 \nThree studies (Rawson et al., 2001; Rawson et al., 2007; Veggi et al., 2013) measured 323 \nROM (Figure 6). Creatine supplementation did not alter ROM at <30 min, 24 hours, 48 324 \nhours, 72 hours, and 96 hours post-exercise. In addition, significant heterogeneity was 325 \nidentified at <30 min, 24 hours, and 72 hours post-exercise. 326 \n 327 \nInflammation and oxidative stress 328 \nOnly one study (Basta et al., 2006; Table 2) included a marker of oxidative stress and 329 \ntherefore no meta-analysis was performed for this outcome. Forrest plots of inflammation 330 \ndata are available in the Online Supplementary Material. Two studies (Bassit et al., 2010; 331 \nRawson et al., 2007) recorded CRP levels (Figure S3). 30 min post-exercise, Bassit et al 332 \n(2010) found no significant differences in CRP between groups. At 24 and 48 hours post-333 \nexercise, creatine supplementation did not blunt the elevations in CR P. Rawson et al 334 \n(2007) also found no differences between groups at 72 hours and 96 hours post-exercise. 335 \n 336 \nTNFα and PGE2 activity was measured by two studies (Bassit et al., 2008; Santos et al., 337 \n2004) and forest plots are displayed in the Online Supplement ary Material (Figures S2 338 \nand S3). Pooled results showed creatine supplementation did not attenuate TNFα or PGE2 339 \nat 24 hours post-exercise with significant heterogeneity identified for both markers . 340 \n\n19 \n \n19 \n \nHowever, at 48 hours post-exercise, Bassit et al (2008) found lower levels of TNFα and 341 \nPGE2 in the creatine-supplemented group. 342 \n 343 \nStudy quality and publication bias 344 \nRisk of bias summaries are presented in the corresponding forest plots (Figures 2-6) and 345 \nFigure 7. Regarding selection bias, random sequence generation was characterised as low 346 \nrisk in two studies who used a computer-generated sequence (Machado et al., 2009) and 347 \na drinks bottle draw (McKinnon et al., 2012). In the remaining eleven studies, bias was 348 \ncharacterised as unclear due to insufficient information on the randomisation procedure. 349 \nAllocation concealment was rated unclear in all studies, as insufficient information was 350 \nprovided to permit judgment. In relation to performance bias, the blinding of participants 351 \nwas categorised as low risk for seven studies and unclear risk for six; for those that were 352 \ncharacterised as unclear risk, three studies poorly described the blinding procedures 353 \n(Santos et al., 2004; Rawson et al., 2007; Machado et al., 2009), while three failed to 354 \nmention the procedures used to blind participants (Basta et al., 2006; McKinnon et al., 355 \n2012; Veggi et al., 2013). Detection bias was categorised as low risk in one study 356 \n(Boychuk et al., 2016), who adequately described the interventions used to blind the 357 \noutcome assessors, but unclear in the remaining twelve studies. Attention and reporting 358 \nbias, and selective outcome reporting, were considered low risk for all included studies . 359 \nFinally, none of the studies appeared to be influenced by other sources of bias, and thus, 360 \nwere characterised as low risk. 361 \n 362 \n\n20 \n \n20 \n \nBased on visual inspections of the funnel plots, there was no evidence of publication bias 363 \n(Figure S4 and S5). However, as alluded to previously, these should be interpreted with 364 \ncaution as tests for funnel plot asymmetry are not robust when <10 studies are included. 365 \n 366 \nSensitivity analysis 367 \nOur sensitivity analysis, in which studies reporting mean change or log-transformed data 368 \nwere removed from analyses, did not significantly affect the results of the meta-analyses 369 \n(data not shown). Although not specified a priori, we did try and explore possible causes 370 \nof the high heterogeneity we observed for many outcomes , using recommendations 371 \noutlined by the Cochrane Handbook (Higgins et al., 2011). There were insufficient studies 372 \nto perform sub-group analysis, so we examined if excluding studies with extreme results 373 \nremoved heterogeneity; however, this made little difference to the results. 374 \n 375 \nDiscussion 376 \nThis is the first systematic review and meta -analysis to examine whether the popular 377 \nergogenic aid creatine can ameliorate symptoms of EIMD. Thirteen studies met our 378 \ninclusion criteria, involving a total of 278 participants. We found no effect of c reatine 379 \nsupplementation on common EIMD markers: the recovery kinetics of muscle strength, 380 \nmuscle soreness, ROM, LDH and inflammation were no different to a placebo up to 96 h 381 \nfollowing exercise. Creatine reduced CK activity but only at 48- h post -exercise. Our 382 \nfindings suggest creat ine supplementation has little practical value as a recovery aid 383 \nfollowing strenuous exercise. 384 \n 385 \n\n21 \n \n21 \n \nWe are unsure why creatine supplementation reduced plasma CK efflux at 48 h post-386 \nexercise but not at other time points. Perhaps it is because this was when CK efflux was 387 \n(on average ) greatest; logically, recovery interventions are most beneficial when the 388 \nmagnitude of EIMD is greatest. Nevertheless, we observed significant heterogeneity at 389 \nthis time point — probably because two studies reported markedly greater decreases in 390 \nCK efflux than the other 5 studies (Figure 4) — so this finding should be interpreted 391 \ncautiously. Regardless of the precise reason s, CK efflux has been criticized as a marker 392 \nof EIMD, as its recovery kinetics do not correlate with markers of muscle soreness and 393 \nmuscle strength, which have more practical relevance for athletes (Manfredi et al., 1991; 394 \nWarren, Lowe, & Armstrong, 1999). Thus, while CK efflux may indicate ultrastructural 395 \ndamage, altering its kinetics does not necess arily translate to enhanced functional 396 \nrecovery. 397 \n 398 \nThe mechanisms by which creatine could modify EIMD are not well understood. Early 399 \nstudies showed that phosphocreatine (PCr) stabilises cell membranes (Saks & Strumia, 400 \n1993) and thus an increase in PCr stores through creatine supplement ation could 401 \ntheoretically stiffen muscle membranes, reducing fluidity, and attenuating intramuscular 402 \ndamage (Rawson et al., 2001). Reduced inflammation and intramuscular Ca2+ influx, and 403 \na subsequent attenuation of proteolysis and oxidative stress , are also frequently cited 404 \neffects of creatine (Bassit et al., 2006; Harty et al., 2019; Deminice et al., 2013), but little 405 \nhuman data is available to support them. Indeed, creatine is a potent antioxidant in vitro 406 \n(Sestili et al., 2006), but few human studies have assessed if this translates to the in vivo 407 \nenvironment. Only one study in this review measured oxidative stress (Basta et al., 2006) 408 \nand while creatine supplementation attenuated lipid oxidation, they used a marker 409 \n\n22 \n \n22 \n \n(thiobarbituric acid reactive substances ) with questionable validity (Powers, Smuder, 410 \nKavazis, & Hudson, 2010). More studies included markers of inflammation, but findings 411 \nwere mixed and non-significant (Figures S1 to S2). No studies evaluated oxidative stress, 412 \nproteolysis, or inflammation in skeletal muscle, which would have provided greater 413 \nmechanistic insights into creatine ’s potential effects in vivo than the systemic markers 414 \nemployed. The limited and equivocal human data showing that creatine supplementation 415 \nexerts anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects post-exercise may explain why we found 416 \nno benefits for most EIMD markers. 417 \n 418 \nThe quality of the included studies was generally good, although their randomisation and 419 \nallocation concealment procedures were often inadequately described (Figures 2-7). The 420 \nchief limitation was the small sample sizes (mean; 10 per group; range: 4 to 23 per group). 421 \nNone reported a priori power analysis to justify their sample sizes, and most were 422 \nprobably insufficiently powered to detect group differences. The small sizes could have 423 \nbiased the overall findings. For example, two studies that found significant benefi ts of 424 \ncreatine on biological markers of EIMD had very low sample sizes (≤n = 6; Bassit et al., 425 \n2008; Bassit et al., 2010). The lower the sample size, the more likely the result does not 426 \nreflect a true effect, and the more likely the magnitude of the effect is exaggerated (Button 427 \net al., 2013). The fact that these studies had mostly different outcome measures to the 428 \nothers included in the analysis, and that they used a different exercise model to induce 429 \nmuscle damage (long distance endurance exercise) , also meant they were more difficult 430 \nto compare to the rest of the included studies. This could have introduced further bias into 431 \nour analysis. Another limitation was that none of the studies verified the supplementation 432 \nprotocol elevated intramuscular creatine stores. It cannot be ruled out that creatine was 433 \n\n23 \n \n23 \n \nineffectual because intramuscular creatine stores were not sufficiently au gmented prior 434 \nto or following exercise. A study that did report benefits of creatine supplementation on 435 \nEIMD markers (Rosene et al., 2009), including strength recovery, was excluded because 436 \nwe could not obtain raw data for both the placebo and creatine group that could be used 437 \nin the meta-analysis. Although it is unlikely that including this study would have altered 438 \nthe overall results, it highlights the importance of future studies presenting all data so that 439 \na meta-analysis can be performed. It does also suggest that creatine supplementation 440 \ncould benefit strength recovery after exercise, but more high- quality studies are needed. 441 \nIn terms of study design, the fact that all the included studies employed a parallel design 442 \nis a strength; indeed, findings from studies employing a crossover design would have 443 \nbeen limited by the repeated bout effect, the phenomenon in which the magnitude of 444 \ndamage evoked by the same or a similar exercise stimulus is lessened in a subsequent 445 \nbout performed several months later (Hyldahl, Chen, Nosaka, 2017). 446 \n 447 \nParadoxically, for decades creatine supplementation has been linked to symptoms of 448 \nexercise-induced rhabdomyolysis (e.g., large increases in serum CK and LDH), muscle 449 \ncramps, and muscle strains (Rawson et al., 2017). This suggests that creatine may in fact 450 \npromote muscle injury or dysfunction after exercise. However, we found no evidence that 451 \ncreatine supplementation exacerbates the symptoms of rhabdomyolysis or impairs muscle 452 \nfunction recovery after exercise, agreeing with a comprehensive review that addressed 453 \nthe link between creatine, rhabdomyolysis, muscle cramp, muscle injury and general 454 \nmuscle dysfunction (Rawson et al., 2017) . On the contrary, our findings suggest that 455 \ncreatine is more likely to attenuate CK post-exercise; thus, creatine supplementation can 456 \n\n24 \n \n24 \n \nbe considered a safe supplement that will not heighten the risk for rhabdomyolysis or 457 \nmuscle dysfunction. 458 \n 459 \nThis review has several limitations. Firstly, there was less than 10 eligible studies for each 460 \noutcome and time point . This limited our statistical power and likely contributed to the 461 \nhigh heterogeneity observed for many outcomes. The low number of studies meant we 462 \ncould not do a sub -group analysis for dose, duration, training status or any of the other 463 \npotentially moderating variables in Table 1. This could have helped to explain the high 464 \nheterogeneity for several outcomes. Secondly, of the 278 participants in this review, 85% 465 \nwere male. Due to potential sex differences in resting muscle creatine (Forsberg, Nilsson, 466 \nWerneman, Bergström, & Hultman, 1991), responses to creatine supplementation (Parise, 467 \nMihic, MacLennan, Yarasheski, & Tarnopolsky, 2001; Tarnopolsky, 2000) and EIMD 468 \n(Clarkson & Hubal, 2001), these findings cannot be generalized to females. As 469 \nacknowledged by recent studies (Amiri, Ghiasvand, Kaviani, Forbes, & Salehi -470 \nAbargouei, 2018; Bieuzen, Bleakley, & Costello, 2013; Bleakley et al., 2012; Costello et 471 \nal., 2016; Ranchordas, Rogerson, Soltani , & Costello, 2018) more exercise science 472 \nresearch is needed in females and this includes high quality research on creatine as a 473 \nrecovery aid. Thirdly, some data had to be extracted from figures using online software, 474 \nincreasing the risk for error. W e did, however, minimise this by having both authors 475 \nperformed the extraction independently. 476 \n 477 \nConclusion 478 \nWe identified 13 studies measuring the effects of creatine supplementation on EIMD. 479 \nWhile creatine is a well-established performance enhancer, our meta-analysis found little 480 \n\n25 \n \n25 \n \nevidence that creatine supplementation is an efficacious recovery aid after exercise. We 481 \ntherefore do not recommend athletes or practitioners use creatine to expedite recovery 482 \nfollowing exercise and instead suggest using strategies with stronger evidence. 483 \nNonetheless, these conclusions are based on a small number of studies in males that had 484 \nlow sample sizes ; thus, they are not definitive. Future research should be adequately 485 \npowered, include female participants, and clarify the mechanisms by which creatine could 486 \nfavourably affect symptoms of EIMD. 487 \n 488 \nDecelerations 489 \nFunding 490 \nNo funding was received for this research. 491 \nConflict of interest 492 \nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest. 493 \nAuthor contributions 494 \nThe study was conceived by TC; data were collected and analysed by TC and BN; data 495 \ninterpretation and manuscript preparation were undertaken by TC and BN; both authors 496 \napproved the final version of the paper. 497 \n\n26 \n \n26 \n \nReferences 498 \n1.
