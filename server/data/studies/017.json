    "abstract": "There has been much debate as to optimal loading strategies for maximising the adaptive response to resistance exercise.\nThe purpose of this paper therefore was to conduct a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials to compare the effects of\nlow-load (≤60% 1 repetition maximum [RM]) versus high-load (≥65% 1 RM) training in enhancing post-exercise muscular\nadaptations. The strength analysis comprised 251 subjects and 32 effect sizes (ESs), nested within 20 treatment groups and\n9 studies. The hypertrophy analysis comprised 191 subjects and 34 ESs, nested with 17 treatment groups and 8 studies.\nThere was a trend for strength outcomes to be greater with high loads compared to low loads (difference = 1.07 ± 0.60;\nCI: −0.18, 2.32;p = 0.09). The mean ES for low loads was 1.23 ± 0.43 (CI: 0.32, 2.13). The mean ES for high loads was\n2.30 ± 0.43 (CI: 1.41, 3.19). There was a trend for hypertrophy outcomes to be greater with high loads compared to low\nloads (difference = 0.43 ± 0.24; CI:−0.05, 0.92;p = 0.076).

    "conclusion": ", training with loads≤50% 1 RM was found to\npromote substantial increases in muscle strength and hypertrophy in untrained individuals, but a trend was noted for\nsuperiority of heavy loading with respect to these outcome measures with null findings likely attributed to a relatively small\nnumber of studies on the topic.\nKeywords: Muscle recruitment, low-load exercise, light weights\nIt has been well established that regimented resist-\nance exercise can promote marked increases in\nmuscle strength and hypertrophy, with improve-\nments in these outcome measures seen irrespective\nof age and gender (Ivey et al., 2000; Kosek,\nKim, Petrella, Cross, & Bamman,2006). Exercise-\ninduced muscular adaptations are at least in part\nattributed to a phenomenon called mechanotrans-\nduction, whereby sarcolemmal-bound mechanosen-\nsors, such as integrins and focal adhesions, convert\nmechanical energy into chemical signals that medi-\nate myocellular anabolic and catabolic pathways\n(Zou et al., 2011). When subjected to mechanical\noverload, the signalling cascade upregulates anabolic\nprocesses in a manner that",

The extent\nof hypertrophy has been shown to vary by fibre\ntype, with fast-twitch (FT) fibres displaying an\napproximately 50% greater capacity for growth in\ncomparison to their slow-twitch (ST) counterparts\n(Adams & Bamman, 2012; Kosek et al.,2006). It\nshould be noted, however, that a high degree of\ninter-individual variability exists in this regard, with\nsome individuals displaying substantially greater ST\nhypertrophy than others (Kosek et al.,2006).\nProper manipulation of programme variables is\nconsidered essential to optimise post-exercise mus-\ncular adaptations (Kraemer & Ratamess,2004).

Proponents claim that complete\nhigh-threshold motor unit recruitment can be\nachieved with low-load training provided repetitions\nare carried out to momentary muscular failure. But\nalthough research clearly shows FT fibres are indeed\nrecruited during low-load training, there is evidence\nthat recruitment does not equal what is achieved\nfrom the use of heavier loads (Akima & Saito,2013;\nCook, Murphy, & Labarbera, 2013). Recent work\nfrom our lab supports these findings, with both mean\nand peak electromyographic values showing mark-\nedly and significantly higher activation during per-\nformance of the leg press at 75% 1 RM versus 30% 1\nRM (Schoenfeld, Contreras, Willardson, Fontana, &\nTiryaki-Sonmez, 2014). Despite this evidence, train-\ning to failure at 30% 1 RM has been found to\nproduce a similar acute muscle protein synthetic\nresponse to a 90% 1 RM protocol 4-h post-exercise,\nwith myofibrillar muscle protein synthesis remaining\nelevated only in the 30% to failure condition at the\n24-h mark (Burd et al.,2010). Moreover, phosphor-\nylation of p70S6K was significantly increased at 4 h\nonly in the 30% to failure condition, and this\nelevation was correlated with the degree of stimula-\ntion of myofibrillar muscle protein synthesis (MPS).\nThese findings suggest that low-load exercise when\nperformed to muscular failure results in greater\nacute adaptive responses compared to training with\nheavy loads. The study did not report muscle protein\nbreakdown, and results were limited by an inability\nto localise MPS based on fibre type. Results were\nalso confounded by a greater total volume of weight\nlifted in the low-load condition. Moreover and\nimportantly, the evaluation of MPS following an\nacute bout of resistance exercise does not always\noccur in parallel with chronic upregulation of caus-\native myogenic signals (Coffey, Shield, et al.,2006a)\nand may not reflect experienced hypertrophic\nresponses subsequent to regimented resistance train-\ning carried out over a period of weeks or months\n(Mitchell, Churchward-Venne, Parise, et al.,2014;\nTimmons, 2011).

Results of these studies\nhave been conflicting. One issue with the current body\nof research on the topic is that studies have employed\nsmall sample sizes. Thus, it is possible that null\nfindings may be attributable to a Type II error as a\nresult of the studies being underpowered. In addi-\ntion, various methodological issues between proto-\ncols confound results, making it difficult to draw\ndefinitive",

The purpose of this paper therefore was to\nconduct a meta-analysis to compare muscular adapta-\ntions between low- and high-load resistance training\nprogrammes.\nMethodology\nInclusion criteria\nOnly randomised controlled trials or randomised\ncrossover trials involving both low- and high-load\ntraining were considered for inclusion. High-load\ntraining was defined here as lifting weights≥65% 1\nRM; low-load training was defined as lifting loads\n≤60% 1 RM. Resistance training protocols had to\nspan at least 6 weeks and directly measure dynamic\nmuscle strength and/or hypertrophy as a primary\noutcome variable. In addition, the training proto-\ncols had to be carried out to momentary muscular\nfailure – the inability to complete another concentric\nrepetition while maintaining proper form.\nSearch strategy\nTo carry out this review, English-language literature\nsearches of the PubMed, EBSCO and Google Scho-\nlar databases were conducted from January 1980 to\nDecember 2013.

The sampling\nvariance for each ES was estimated according to\nMorris and DeShon ( 2002). Calculation of the\nsampling variance required an estimate of the popu-\nlation ES and the pretest–posttest correlation for\neach individual ES. The population ES was esti-\nmated by calculating the mean ES across all studies\nand treatment groups (Morris & DeShon, 2002).\nThe pretest–posttest correlation was calculated using\nthe following formula (Morris & DeShon,2002):\nr ¼\ns2\n1 þ s2\n2 /C0 s2\nD\n/C0/C1\n2s1s2ðÞ\nwhere s1 and s2 are the SD for the pre- and posttest\nmeans, respectively, and sD is the SD of the difference\nscores. sD was estimated using the following formula\n(Technical guide: Data analysis and interpretation\n[online]):\ns\nD ¼\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\ns2\n1\nn\n/C18/C19\nþ s2\n2\nn\n/C18/C19/C18/C19s\nStatistical analyses\nMeta-analyses were performed using hierarchical\nlinear mixed models, modelling the variation\nbetween studies as a random effect, the variation\nbetween treatment and control groups as a random\neffect nested within studies and the low- versus high-\nload comparison as a fixed effect (Hox & de Leeuw,\n2003).

With respect to muscle hypertrophy, we\nfound no significant differences in ES between high-\nversus low-load training protocols. To an extent,\nthese results run contrary to established guidelines\nfor hypertrophy training, which state that loads\ngreater than ~65% 1 RM are needed to maximise\nthe hypertrophic response (Kraemer & Ratamess,\n2004; Kraemer et al.,2002; McDonagh & Davies,\n1984). The current study provides compelling evid-\nence that substantial muscle growth can in fact be\nachieved training with loads≤60% 1 RM, with gains\napproaching those using higher percentages of 1\nRM. It should be noted, however, that there was a\ntrend for greater growth when using heavy loads as\ncompared to light loads (p = 0.076). This is reflected\nin the mean ES data, where high-load training\nshowed a strong effect for hypertrophy (0.82 ±\n0.17) while low-load training showed only a moder-\nate effect (0.39 ± 0.17). These data suggest that\nthose seeking to maximise hypertrophy might benefit\nfrom the use of heavier loads.\nWith respect to increases in muscular strength, no\nsignificant differences in ES were seen between high-\nand low-load training protocols. Consistent with the\nconcept of a“strength-endurance continuum,” it is\ngenerally believed that adaptations associated with\nlight-load protocols are specific to enhancing mus-\ncular endurance and that any improvements in the\nability to exert maximal force are minimal (Campos\net al., 2002). On the surface, results of the present\nstudy would seem to refute these assertions as\npooled analysis of results showed that significant\nincreases in strength are possible when low-load\ntraining is carried out to muscular failure. However,\ncloser scrutiny of data indicates that these findings\nmust be interpreted with caution. Although both\nhigh- and low-load training showed a strong effect\nfor increases in strength, the magnitude of the\ndifference in means for ES was large between the\ntwo protocols (2.30 ± 0.43 versus 1.23 ± 0.43,\nrespectively), and the p-value for the difference\nshowed a trend for significance in favour of high-\nload training (p = 0.09). In addition, the 95% CI\ndifferential favoured high-load training (CI:−0.18–\n2.32). Moreover, as seen inFigure 2, all nine studies\ninvestigating the topic favoured high-load training,\nand six of these studies showed a moderate to strong\ndifference in magnitude of effect. Taken in com-\nbination, it can be inferred that the relative paucity of\nstudies on the topic limited statistical power and thus\nobscured our ability to detect significant differences.\nWhile it is evident that low-load training can promote\nrobust increases in muscular strength, the body of\nresearch would seem to suggest that the use of\nheavier loads might be required for maximum effect.\nFigure 3. Forest plot of the impact of load on hypertrophy by study.\nMuscular adaptations in low- versus high-load resistance training 7\nDownloaded by [Akdeniz Universitesi] at 12:10 20 December 2014 \n\n\nIt is not clear from our analysis whether hyper-\ntrophy in low- versus high-load training manifested\nin a fibre-type specific manner. As previously men-\ntioned, there is evidence that muscle fibre recruit-\nment is suboptimal when training with low loads\n(Akima & Saito, 2013; Cook et al.,2013). Recent\nwork from our lab found that heavy-load training\nproduced significantly greater mean and peak mus-\ncle activation of thigh musculature compared to low-\nload training (by 35% and 22%, respectively) during\nperformance of the leg press (Schoenfeld et al.,\n2014). On the other hand, the duration of the light-\nload set was three- to four-fold higher compared to\nthe heavy-load set, indicating that fibres activated\nduring light-load training received considerably\ngreater time-under-load (TUL) versus that achieved\nduring heavy loading. Given that Type I fibres have a\nhigher threshold for fatigability, the greater TUL\nduring low-load training would conceivably max-\nimise their stimulation and thus promote a greater\nhypertrophic response. This hypothesis is consistent\nwith the findings of Mitchell et al. ( 2012), who\ncompared knee extension training at 80% of 1-RM\nversus 30% of 1-RM over 10 weeks. Although\nsimilar increases between groups were reported in\nwhole muscle hypertrophy of the quadriceps as\nassessed by magnetic resonance imaging, tissue\nanalysis from muscle biopsy revealed an increased\nType I fibre area in the low-load condition (~23%\nversus ~16% in low versus high load, respectively),\nwhereas the high-load condition favoured greater\nType II fibre area (~15% versus ~12% in high versus\nlow load, respectively). Other studies that have\ninvestigated the topic have failed to show a fibre-\ntype-specific response across the strength-endurance\ncontinuum (Campos et al., 2002; Schuenke et al.,\n2012). The reason for discrepancies between studies\nis not clear. Further research is needed to provide\nclarity on whether differences do in fact exist\nbetween loading strategies with respect to fibre-type\nhypertrophy and, if so, quantify the magnitude of\nthese differences.\nAn important consideration to take into account\nwhen generalising results of this meta-analysis is that\nall of the included studies employed untrained or\nrecreationally trained subjects. There is evidence\nthat regular performance of resistance training can\nmodulate the hypertrophic response to loading\n(Schoenfeld, 2013). As an individual gains lifting\nexperience, a “ceiling effect” makes it progressively\nmore difficult to increase muscle mass, perhaps\nmediated by an altered anabolic intracellular signal-\nling cascade (Coffey, Zhong, et al., 2006; Ogasa-\nwara, Kobayashi, et al., 2013). In support of this\npoint, untrained subjects have been shown to\nincrease muscle mass from cardiovascular exercise–\na modality that is not sufficient to induce hypertrophy\nin a well-trained population (Konopka & Harber,\n2014). Thus, more demanding resistance training\nprotocols may be needed to elicit a hypertrophic\nresponse in those who regularly lift weights, perhaps\nincluding the use of heavier loads. Similarly, while\nloads ≤60% 1 RM can promote significant strength\nincreases, some researchers have put forth the notion\nthat greater loading is required as an individual attains\na more advanced training status to realise further\nimprovements (Kraemer & Ratamess, 2004). This\nhypothesis is based on the fact that early-phase\nstrength-related adaptations are characterised by\nenhancements in motor learning and coordination\nand that heavier loads are therefore necessary to\nmaximise strength-related outcomes once an indi-\nvidual acquires these basic motor skills. A ceiling\neffect might have implications with respect to strength\ngains as well. Future research should seek to invest-\nigate the response to different loading strategies in\nthose with at least one year of consistent resistance\ntraining experience.\nA limitation of current research on high versus low\nloading is the relatively brief duration of the training\nprotocols. The longest study spanned 13 weeks and\nseveral were as short as 6 weeks. Although these time\nframes are certainly long enough to realise significant\nincreases in muscular strength and hypertrophy, it\nremains to be determined whether results would\ndiverge over longer training periods. This conun-\ndrum should be addressed in future research. It\nshould also be noted that the studies included for\nanalysis had inherent differences in manipulation of\nvariables, such as exercise selection, rest intervals\nand frequency. Thus, pooling of data may not\nnecessarily reflect these discrepancies and their\npotential impact on results. Although no statistically\nsignificant differences were noted between condi-\ntions, the variability in the response to training and\nthe observed trend for a positive effect of heavy-load\ntraining warrants further research with larger sample\nsizes.\nPractical applications\nThis meta-analysis provides compelling evidence\nthat training with loads≤60% 1 RM can promote\nsubstantial increases in muscle strength and hyper-\ntrophy in untrained individuals. However, a strong\ntrend was noted for superiority of heavy loading with\nrespect to these outcome measures, with null find-\nings likely attributed to the relatively small number\nof studies meeting inclusion criteria. It may well be\nthat a combination of heavy and light loading is best\nfor maximising muscular adaptations associated with\nresistance training, conceivably by promoting\noptimal hypertrophy of both Type I and Type II\nmuscle fibres. Our findings also have important\n8 B. J. Schoenfeld et al.\nDownloaded by [Akdeniz Universitesi] at 12:10 20 December 2014 \n\n\nimplications for the elderly and those suffering from\nmusculoskeletal conditions, such as osteoarthritis,\nwho clearly can enhance muscular adaptations by\ntraining with lighter loads that are more easily\ntolerated. Given the dearth of data on experienced\nlifters, future research should focus on elucidating\nthe response of well-trained populations to low-\nversus high-load protocols.\nReferences\nAdams, G., & Bamman, M.
