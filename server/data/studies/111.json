    "introduction": "D\niabetes has become a widespread\nepidemic, primarily because of the\nincreasing prevalence and inci-\ndence of type 2 diabetes. According to the\nCenters for Disease Control and Preven-\ntion, in 2007, almost 24 million Ameri-\ncans had diabetes, with one-quarter of\nthose, or six million, undiagnosed (261).\nCurrently, it is estimated that almost 60\nmillion U.S. residents also have prediabe-\ntes, a condition in which blood glucose\n(BG) levels are above normal, thus greatly\nincreasing their risk for type 2 diabetes\n(261). Lifetime risk estimates suggest that\none in three Americans born in 2000 or\nlater will develop diabetes, but in high-\nrisk ethnic populations, closer to 50%\nmay develop it (200). Type 2 diabetes is a\nsigniﬁcant cause of premature mortality\nand morbidity related to cardiovascular\ndisease (CVD), blindness, kidney and\nnerve disease, and amputation (261). Al-\nthough regular physical activity (PA) may\nprevent or delay diabetes and its compli-\ncations (10,46,89,112,176,208,259,294),\nmost people with type 2 diabetes are not\nactive (193).\nIn this article, the broader term\n“physical activity” (deﬁned as “bodily\nmovement produced by the contraction\nof skeletal muscle that substantially in-\ncreases energy expenditure”) is used in-\nterchangeably with “exercise,” which is\ndeﬁned as “a subset of PA done with the\nintention of developing physical ﬁtness\n(i.e., cardiovascular [CV], strength, and\nﬂexibility training).” The intent is to rec-\nognize that many types of physical move-\nment may have a positive effect on\nphysical ﬁtness, morbidity, and mortality\nin individuals with type 2 diabetes.\nDiagnosis, classiﬁcation, and\netiology of diabetes\nCurrently, the American Diabetes Associ-\nation (ADA) recommends the use of any\nof the following four criteria for diagnos-\ning diabetes: 1) glycated hemoglobin\n(A1C) value of 6.5% or higher,2) fasting\nplasma glucose /H11350126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/\nl), 3) 2-h plasma glucose /H11350200 mg/dl\n(11.1 mmol/l) during an oral glucose tol-\nerance test using 75 g of glucose, and/or\n4) classic symptoms of hyperglycemia\n(e.g., polyuria, polydipsia, and unex-\nplained weight loss) or hyperglycemic cri-\nsis with a random plasma glucose of 200\nmg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) or higher. In the ab-\nsence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, the\nﬁrst three criteria should be conﬁrmed by\nrepeat testing (4). Prediabetes is diag-\nnosed with an A1C of 5.7– 6.4%, fasting\nplasma glucose of 100 –125 mg/dl (5.6 –\n6.9 mmol/l; i.e., impaired fasting glucose\n[IFG]), or 2-h postload glucose of 140 –\n199 mg/dl (7.8 –11.0 mmol/l; i.e., im-\npaired glucose tolerance [IGT]) (4).\nThe major forms of diabetes can be\ncategorized as type 1 or type 2 (4). In type\n1 diabetes, which accounts for 5–10% of\ncases, the cause is an absolute deﬁciency\nof insulin secretion resulting from auto-\nimmune destruction of the insulin-\nproducing cells in the pancreas.

    "results": "from a\ncombination of the inability of muscle\ncells to respond to insulin properly (insu-\nlin resistance) and inadequate compensa-\ntory insulin secretion. Less common\nforms include gestational diabetes melli-\ntus (GDM), which is associated with a\n40 – 60% chance of developing type 2 di-\nabetes in the next 5–10 years (261). Dia-\nbetes can also result from genetic defects\nin insulin action, pancreatic disease, sur-\ngery, infections, and drugs or chemicals\n(4,261).\nGenetic and environmental factors\nare strongly implicated in the develop-\nment of type 2 diabetes. The exact genetic\ndefects are complex and not clearly de-\nﬁned (4), but risk increases with age, obe-\nsity, and physical inactivity. Type 2\ndiabetes occurs more frequently in popu-\nlations with hypertension or dyslipide-\nmia, women with previous GDM, and\nnon-Caucasian people including Native\nAmericans, African Americans, Hispanic/\nLatinos, Asians, and Paciﬁc Islanders.\nTreatment goals in type 2 diabetes\nThe goal of treatment in type 2 diabetes is\nto achieve and maintain optimal BG,\nlipid, and blood pressure (BP) levels to\nprevent or delay chronic complications of\ndiabetes (5). Many people with type 2 di-\nabetes can achieve BG control by follow-\ning a nutritious meal plan and exercise\nprogram, losing excess weight, imple-\nmenting necessary self-care behaviors,\nand taking oral medications, although\nothers may need supplemental insulin\n(261). Diet and PA are central to the man-\nagement and prevention of type 2 diabe-\ntes because they help treat the associated\nglucose, lipid, BP control abnormalities,\nas well as aid in weight loss and mainte-\nnance. When medications are used to\ncontrol type 2 diabetes, they should aug-\nment lifestyle improvements, not replace\nthem.\nACUTE EFFECTS OF\nEXERCISE\nFuel metabolism during exercise\nFuel mobilization, glucose production,\nand muscle glycogenolysis. The main-\ntenance of normal BG at rest and during\nexercise depends largely on the coordina-\ntion and integration of the sympathetic\nnervous and endocrine systems (250).\nContracting muscles increase uptake of\nBG, although BG levels are usually main-\ntained by glucose production via liver gly-\ncogenolysis and gluconeogenesis and\nmobilization of alternate fuels, such as\nfree fatty acids (FFAs) (250,268).\nSeveral factors inﬂuence exercise fuel\nuse, but the most important are the inten-\nsity and duration of PA (9,29,47,83,111,\n133,160,181,241). Any activity causes a\nshift from predominant reliance on FFA at\nrest to a blend of fat, glucose, and muscle\nglycogen, with a small contribution\nfrom amino acids (15,31). With in-\ncreasing exercise intensity, there is a\ngreater reliance on carbohydrate as long\nas sufﬁcient amounts are available in\nmuscle or blood (21,23,47,133). Early\nin exercise, glycogen provides the bulk\nof the fuel for working muscles. As gly-\ncogen stores become depleted, muscles\nincrease their uptake and use of circu-\nlating BG, along with FFA released from\nadipose tissue (15,132, 271). Intramus-\ncular lipid stores are more readily used\nduring longer-duration activities and\nrecovery (23,223,270). Glucose pro-\nduction also shifts from hepatic glyco-\ngenolysis to enhanced gluconeogenesis\nas duration increases (250,268).\nEvidence statement. PA causes increased\nglucose uptake into active muscles bal-\nanced by hepatic glucose production,\nwith a greater reliance on carbohydrate to\nfuel muscular activity as intensity in-\ncreases. The American College of Sports\nMedicine (ACSM) evidence category A(see\nTables 1 and 2 for explanation).\nInsulin-independent and insulin-\ndependent muscle glucose uptake dur-\ning exercise. There are two well-deﬁned\npathways that stimulate glucose uptake\nby muscle (96). At rest and postprandi-\nally, its uptake by muscle is insulin de-\npendent and serves primarily to replenish\nmuscle glycogen stores. During exercise,\ncontractions increase BG uptake to sup-\nplement intramuscular glycogenolysis\n(220,227). As the two pathways are dis-\ntinct, BG uptake into working muscle is\nnormal even when insulin-mediated up-\ntake is impaired in type 2 diabetes\n(28,47,293). Muscular BG uptake re-\nmains elevated postexercise, with the\ncontraction-mediated pathway persist-\ning for several hours(86,119) and insulin-\nmediated uptake for longer (9,33,141, 226).\nGlucose transport into skeletal mus-\ncle is accomplished via GLUT proteins,\nwith GLUT4 being the main isoform in\nmuscle modulated by both insulin and\ncontractions (110,138). Insulin activates\nGLUT4 translocation through a complex\nsignaling cascade (256,293). Contrac-\ntions, however, trigger GLUT4 transloca-\ntion at least in part through activation of\n5/H11032-AMP–activated protein kinase\n(198,293). Insulin-stimulated GLUT4\ntranslocation is generally impaired in type\n2 diabetes (96). Both aerobic and resis-\ntance exercises increase GLUT4 abun-\ndance and BG uptake,even in the presence\nof type 2 diabetes (39,51,204,270).\nEvidence statement. Insulin-stimulated\nBG uptake into skeletal muscle predomi-\nnates at rest and is impaired in type 2\ndiabetes, while muscular contractions\nstimulate BG transport via a separate ad-\nditive mechanism not impaired by insulin\nresistance or type 2 diabetes.ACSM evi-\ndence category A.\nPostexercise glycemic control/BG\nlevels\nAerobic exercise effects. During mod-\nerate-intensity exercise in nondiabetic\npersons, the rise in peripheral glucose up-\ntake is matched by an equal rise in hepatic\nglucose production, the result being that\nBG does not change except during pro-\nlonged, glycogen-depleting exercise. In\nindividuals with type 2 diabetes perform-\ning moderate exercise, BG utilization by\nmuscles usually rises more than hepatic\nglucose production, and BG levels tend to\ndecline (191). Plasma insulin levels nor-\nmally fall, however, making the risk of\nexercise-induced hypoglycemia in any-\none not taking insulin or insulin secreta-\ngogues very minimal, even with\nprolonged PA (152). The effects of a sin-\ngle bout of aerobic exercise on insulin ac-\ntion vary with duration, intensity, and\nsubsequent diet; a single session in-\ncreases insulin action and glucose toler-\nance for more than 24 h but less than\n72 h (26,33,85,141). The effects of\nmoderate aerobic exercise are similar\nwhether the PA is performed in a single\nsession or multiple bouts with the same\ntotal duration (14).\nDuring brief, intense aerobic exercise,\nplasma catecholamine levels rise mark-\nedly, driving a major increase in glucose\nproduction (184). Hyperglycemia can re-\nsult from such activity and persist for up\nto 1–2 h, likely because plasma catechol-\namine levels and glucose production do\nnot return to normal immediately with\ncessation of the activity (184).\nEvidence statement. Although moderate\naerobic exercise improves BG and insulin ac-\ntion acutely, the risk of exercise-induced hy-\npoglycemia is minimal without use of\nexogenous insulin or insulin secretagogues.\nTransient hyperglycemia can follow intense\nPA.ACSM evidence category C.\nExercise and type 2 diabetes\ne148 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 33, NUMBER 12, DECEMBER 2010 care.diabetesjournals.org\nDownloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/33/12/e147/604952/zdc0121000e147.pdf by guest on 04 December 2025\n\n\nResistance exercise effects. The acute\neffects of a single bout of resistance train-\ning on BG levels and/or insulin action in\nindividuals with type 2 diabetes have not\nbeen reported. In individuals with IFG\n(BG levels of 100 –125 mg/dl), resistance\nexercise results in lower fasting BG levels\n24 h after exercise, with greater reduc-\ntions in response to both volume (multi-\nple- vs. single-set sessions) and intensity\nof resistance exercise (vigorous compared\nwith moderate) (18).\nEvidence statement. The acute effects of\nresistance exercise in type 2 diabetes have\nnot been reported, but result in lower fast-\ning BG levels for at least 24 h after exercise\nin individuals with IFG. ACSM evidence\ncategory C.\nCombined aerobic and resistance and\nother types of training.A combination\nof aerobic and resistance training may be\nmore effective for BG management than\neither type of exercise alone (51,238).\nAny increase in muscle mass that may re-\nsult from resistance training could con-\ntribute to BG uptake without altering the\nmuscle’s intrinsic capacity to respond to\ninsulin, whereas aerobic exercise en-\nhances its uptake via a greater insulin ac-\ntion, independent of changes in muscle\nmass or aerobic capacity (51). However,\nall reported combination training had a\ngreater total duration of exercise and ca-\nloric use than when each type of training\nwas undertaken alone (51,183,238).\nMild-intensity exercises such as tai chi\nand yoga have also been investigated for\ntheir potential to improve BG manage-\nment, with mixed results (98,117,159,\n257,269,286,291). Although tai chi may\nlead to short-term improvements in BG\nlevels, effects from long-term training\n(i.e., 16 weeks) do not seem to last 72 h\nafter the last session (257). Some studies\nhave shown lower overall BG levels with\nextended participation in such activities\n(286,291), although others have not\n(159,257). One study suggested that yo-\nga’s beneﬁts on fasting BG, lipids, oxida-\ntive stress markers, and antioxidant status\nare at least equivalent to more conven-\ntional forms of PA (98). However, a meta-\nanalysis of yoga studies stated that the\nlimitations characterizing most studies,\nsuch as small sample size and varying\nforms of yoga, preclude drawing ﬁrm\nconclusions about beneﬁts to diabetes\nmanagement (117).\nEvidence statement. A combination of\naerobic and resistance exercise training\nmay be more effective in improving BG\ncontrol than either alone; however, more\nstudies are needed to determine if total\ncaloric expenditure, exercise duration, or\nexercise mode is responsible.ACSM evi-\ndence category B.

Most beneﬁts of PA on type 2\ndiabetes management and prevention are\nrealized through acute and chronic im-\nprovements in insulin action (29,46,\n116,118,282). The acute effects of a re-\ncent bout of exercise account for most of\nthe improvements in insulin action, with\nmost individuals experiencing a decrease\nin their BG levels during mild- and mod-\nerate-intensity exercise and for 2–72 h af-\nterward (24,83,204).\nBG reductions are related to the dura-\ntion and intensity of the exercise, preex-\nercise control, and state of physical\ntraining (24,26,47,238). Although previ-\nous PA of any intensity generally exerts its\neffects by enhancing uptake of BG for gly-\ncogen synthesis (40,83) and by stimulat-\ning fat oxidation and storage in muscle\n(21,64,95), more prolonged or intense PA\nacutely enhances insulin action for longer\nperiods (9,29,75,111,160,238).\nAcute improvements in insulin sensi-\ntivity in women with type 2 diabetes have\nbeen found for equivalent energy expen-\nditures whether engaging in low-intensity\nor high-intensity walking (29) but may be\naffected by age and training status\n(24,75,100,101,228). For example, mod-\nerate- to heavy-intensity aerobic training\nundertaken three times a week for 6\nmonths improved insulin action in both\nyounger and older women but persisted\nonly in the younger group for 72–120 h.\nAcute changes in liver’s ability to pro-\ncess glucose. Increases in liver fatcon-\ntent common in obesity and type 2 diabetes\nare strongly associated with reduced he-\npatic and peripheral insulin action. En-\nhanced whole-body insulin action after\naerobic training seems to be related to gains\nin peripheral, not hepatic, insulin action\n(146,282). Such training not resulting in\noverall weight loss may still reduce hepatic\nlipid content and alter fat partitioning and\nuse in the liver (128).\nEvidence statement.

Training can\nenhance the responsiveness of skeletal\nmuscles to insulin with increased expres-\nsion and/or activity of proteins involved\nin glucose metabolism and insulin signal-\ning (39,110,204,270). Moderate training\nmay increase glycogen synthase activity\nand GLUT4 protein expression but not\ninsulin signaling (39). Fat oxidation is\nalso a key aspect of improved insulin ac-\ntion, and training increases lipid storage\nin muscle and fat oxidation capacity\n(64,95,136,223).\nAn individual’s training status will af-\nfect the use of carbohydrate during an aer-\nobic activity. Aerobic training increases\nfat utilization during a similar duration\nbout of low- or moderate-intensity activ-\nity done after training, which spares mus-\ncle glycogen and BG and results in a lesser\nacute decrease in BG (28,83,223). Type 2\ndiabetes may be associated with a de-\ncrease in lipid oxidation and shift toward\ngreater carbohydrate oxidation at all exer-\ncise intensities (87).\nResistance exercise training also ben-\neﬁts BG control and insulin action in type\n2 diabetes (46,65,115,116,118,246). In a\nrandomized controlled trial (RCT), twice-\nweekly progressive resistance training for\n16 weeks by older men with newly diag-\nnosed type 2 diabetes resulted in a 46.3%\nincrease in insulin action, a 7.1% reduc-\ntion in fasting BG levels, and signiﬁcant\nloss of visceral fat (116). An increase in\nmuscle mass from resistance training may\ncontribute to BG uptake from a mass ef-\nfect, and heavy weight training in partic-\nular may reverse or prevent further loss of\nskeletal muscle due to disuse and aging\n(34,276). In another RCT, all 20 men\nwith type 2 diabetes who participated in\neither resistance or aerobic exercise thrice\nweekly for 10 weeks improved their over-\nall BG control, but those doing resistance\ntraining had signiﬁcantly lower A1C val-\nues (32). Diabetic women undergoing 12\nweeks of low-intensity training with resis-\ntance bands had gains in strength and\nmuscle mass and loss of fat mass but had\nno change in insulin sensitivity (157).\nEvidence statement. Both aerobic and\nresistance training improve insulin ac-\ntion, BG control, and fat oxidation and\nstorage in muscle.ACSM evidence category\nB. Resistance exercise enhances skeletal\nmuscle mass.ACSM evidence category A.\nLipids and lipoproteins. Small RCTs\ninvolving type 2 diabetes have reported\nthat aerobic training decreases total and\nLDL cholesterol and raises HDL choles-\nterol (130,229). One larger RCT found\ndecreases in total cholesterol with both\naerobic and yoga training but no changes\nin HDL cholesterol or LDL cholesterol\n(98), although most have found no effect\nof any form of exercise training on lipids\n(6,175,178,238,258,267). RCTs de-\nsigned to increase PA also had no effect on\nthe cholesterol proﬁle in type 2 diabetes,\nwith most also ﬁnding no change in trig-\nlycerides (6,175,238,258,267). A meta-\nanalysis of training effects on blood lipids\nin adults with type 2 diabetes found, how-\never, that LDL cholesterol may be reduced\nby /H110115% (136).\nLipid proﬁles may beneﬁt more from\nconcomitant exercise training and weight\nreduction. Some studies using intensive\ndiet and aerobic exercise interventions re-\nported large reductions in total choles-\nterol and triglycerides but failed to\ninclude controls (12,13). In the Look\nAHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes)\nstudy, intensive lifestyle participants ex-\nhibited greater decreases in triglycerides\nand increases in HDL cholesterol than the\ncontrol group, while both the intensive\nlifestyle and usual care groups decreased\nLDL cholesterol (218). Most lifestyle in-\nterventions have been accompanied by an\napproximate 5-kg weight loss.\nEvidence statement. Blood lipid re-\nsponses to training are mixed but may result\nin a small reduction in LDL cholesterol with\nno change in HDL cholesterol or triglycer-\nides. Combined weight loss and PA may be\nmore effective than aerobic exercise training\nalone on lipids.ACSM evidence category C.\nHypertension. Hypertension is a com-\nmon comorbidity affecting more than\n60% of individuals with type 2 diabetes\n(201,249). The risk of vascular complica-\ntions in hypertensive individuals with\ntype 2 diabetes is 66 –100% higher than\nwith either condition alone (103,195).\nBoth aerobic and resistance training can\nlower BP in nondiabetic individuals, with\nslightly greater effects observed with the\nformer (49,134,135,137). Most observa-\ntional studies show that both exercises\nlower BP in diabetic individuals (35,\n46,78,208,267). Several RCTs have\nshown reductions in systolic BP (4 – 8\nmmHg), but only one reported a slightly\nlower diastolic BP (11,130,140,176). The\nLook AHEAD trial found reductions in\nboth systolic and diastolic BP with exer-\ncise and weight loss (218), but several\nstudies have reported no changes in BP\nwith training in type 2 diabetes\n(175,238,283). Carefully designed RCTs\nusing increasing levels of PA also failed to\nshow any change in BP despite substan-\ntially increased PA (6,258).\nEvidence statement. Aerobic training\nmay slightly reduce systolic BP, but re-\nductions in diastolic BP are less common,\nin individuals with type 2 diabetes.ACSM\nevidence category C.\nMortality and CV risk.Higher levels of\nphysical ﬁtness and PA are associated\nwith lower CV risk and mortality in both\nhealthy and clinical populations (19,\n153,164,207). Increases in PA and phys-\nical ﬁtness are also associated with re-\nduced early mortality in both populations\nas well (19,42,153,163,164,186,272).\nAll-cause and CV mortality risk was 1.7–\n6.6 times higher in low-ﬁt compared with\nhigh-ﬁt men with type 2 diabetes, with\nthe ﬁttest men exhibiting the lowest risk\n(42,43). A work capacity /H1102210 METs\n(where 1 MET is deﬁned as the equivalent\nof resting metabolic rate) carries the low-\nest risk, independent of obesity\n(42,153,186). No RCT data on the effects\nof changes in physical ﬁtness on mortality\nin diabetes exist.\nEvidence statement. Observational\nstudies suggest that greater PA and ﬁtness\nare associated with a lower risk of all-\ncause and CV mortality. ACSM evidence\ncategory C.\nBody weight: maintenance and loss.\nThe most successful programs for long-\nterm weight control have involved com-\nbinations of diet, exercise, and behavior\nmodiﬁcation (281). Exercise interven-\ntions undertaken with volumes typically\nrecommended to improve BG control and\nreduce CVD risk (e.g., 150 min/week of\nbrisk walking) are usually insufﬁcient for\nmajor weight loss (24), likely because\nobese and older people frequently have\ndifﬁculty performing sufﬁcient exercise to\ncreate a large energy deﬁcit and can easily\ncounterbalance expenditures by eating\nmore (281). However, in RCTs, about 1 h\nof daily moderate aerobic exercise pro-\nduces at least as much fat loss as equiva-\nlent caloric restriction, with resultant\ngreater insulin action (231,232).\nThe optimal volume of exercise to\nachieve sustained major weight loss is\nprobably much larger than the amount\nrequired to achieve improved BG control\nand CV health (24,217). In observational\nstudies (234,235,274), individuals who\nsuccessfully maintained large weight loss\nduring at least a year typically engaged in\n/H110117 h/week of moderate- to vigorous-\nintensity exercise (62). Two RCTs found\nExercise and type 2 diabetes\ne152 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 33, NUMBER 12, DECEMBER 2010 care.diabetesjournals.org\nDownloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/33/12/e147/604952/zdc0121000e147.pdf by guest on 04 December 2025\n\n\nthat higher exercise volumes (2,000 and\n2,500 kcal/week) produced greater and\nmore sustained weight loss than 1,000\nkcal/week of exercise (123,124).\nEvidence statement. Recommended lev-\nels of PA may help produce weight loss.\nHowever, up to 60 min/day may be re-\nquired when relying on exercise alone for\nweight loss.ACSM evidence category C.\nSupervision of training.Exercise inter-\nvention studies showing the greatest ef-\nfect on BG control have all involved\nsupervision of exercise sessions by quali-\nﬁed exercise trainers (34,65,196,238).\nThe most direct test of the incremental\nbeneﬁts of supervised training was the\nItalian Diabetes and Exercise Study (11).\nIn this 1-year trial, all 606 participants with\ntype 2 diabetes (both intervention and con-\ntrol) received high-quality exercise counsel-\ning that increased self-reported PA\nsubstantially. Theintervention group also\nreceived supervised, facility-based com-\nbined aerobic and resistance exercise\ntraining twice weekly, resulting in greater\nimprovements in overall BG control, BP,\nBMI, waist circumference, HDL choles-\nterol, and estimated 10-year CVD risk. A\nrecent systematic review of 20 resistance\ntraining studies on type 2 diabetes (97)\nfound that supervised training of varying\nvolume, frequency, and intensity im-\nproved BG control and insulin sensitivity,\nbut that when supervision was removed,\ncompliance and BG control both\ndeteriorated.\nEvidence statement. Individuals with\ntype 2 diabetes engaged in supervised\ntraining exhibit greater compliance and\nBG control than those undertaking exer-\ncise training without supervision.ACSM\nevidence category B.\nPsychological effects. Exercise likely\nhas psychological beneﬁts for persons\nwith type 2 diabetes, although evidence\nfor acute and chronic psychological ben-\neﬁts is limited. In the Look AHEAD trial,\nparticipants in the intensive lifestyle inter-\nvention attempted to lose more than 7%\nof their initial weight and increase mod-\nerately intense PA to greater than 175\nmin/week. They had improvements in\nhealth-related (SF-36 physical compo-\nnent scores) quality of life (QOL) and de-\npression symptoms after 12 months that\nwere mediated by enhanced physical ﬁt-\nness (280).\nHowever, it seems that individuals\nwho undertake exercise to prevent a\nchronic disease fare better than those who\nundertake it to manage an existing one. A\nrecent meta-analysis found that while\npsychological well-being was signiﬁ-\ncantly improved among individuals who\nexercised for disease prevention, it dete-\nriorated signiﬁcantly when undertaken\nfor management of CVD, end-stage renal\ndisease, pulmonary disease, neurological\ndisorders, and cancer (90). These ﬁnd-\nings suggest that beneﬁts may vary, with\nthose with fewer existing complications\nbeneﬁting the most.\nMeta-analyses of clinically depressed\nmen and women of all age-groups found\nsubstantial decreases in depressive symp-\ntoms after both short and long courses of\nexercise (50) and clinical depression and\ndepressive symptoms among the aged\n(243). Potential mechanisms of exercise\ninclude psychological factors, such as in-\ncreased self-efﬁcacy, a sense of mastery,\ndistraction, and changes in self-concept,\nas well as physiological factors such as in-\ncreased central norepinephrine transmis-\nsion, changes in the hypothalamic\nadrenocortical system (63), serotonin\nsynthesis and metabolism (61), and en-\ndorphins. Regular PA may improve psy-\nchological well-being, health-related\nQOL, and depression in individuals with\ntype 2 diabetes, among whom depression\nis more common than in the general pop-\nulation (73).\nEvidence statement. Increased PA and\nphysical ﬁtness can reduce symptoms of\ndepression and improve health-related\nQOL in those with type 2 diabetes.ACSM\nevidence category B.\nPA AND PREVENTION OF\nTYPE 2 DIABETES— Participation\nin regular PA improves BG control and\ncan prevent or delay onset of type 2 dia-\nbetes (64,104,149,158, 170,260). Pro-\nspective cohort and cross-sectional\nobservational studies that assessed PA\nwith questionnaires showed that higher\nPA levels are associated with reduced risk\nfor type 2 diabetes, regardless of method\nof activity assessment, ranges of activity\ncategories, and statistical",
    "methods": "(108,113,182). Both moderate walking\nand vigorous activity have been associ-\nated with a decreased risk, and greater\nvolumes of PA may provide the most pre-\nvention (113). Observational studies have\nreported that greater ﬁtness is associated\nwith a reduced risk of developing type 2\ndiabetes (251,273), even if only moder-\nate-intensity exercise is undertaken.\nThe Da Qing study in China (211)\nincluded an exercise-only treatment arm\nand reported that even modest changes in\nexercise (20 min of mild or moderate, 10\nmin of strenuous, or 5 min of very stren-\nuous exercise one to two times a day) re-\nduced diabetes risk by 46% (compared\nwith 42% for diet plus exercise and 31%\nfor diet alone). The Finnish Diabetes Pre-\nvention Study (74,260) and the U.S. Dia-\nbetes Prevention Program (DPP) (149)\nincluded intensive, lifestyle modiﬁcations\nwith both diet and increased PA. In the\nformer, 522 middle-aged, overweight\nadults with IGT completed either lifestyle\nmodiﬁcations of at least 30 min of daily,\nmoderate PA, or no change in behavior\n(74,260). The DPP randomized 3,234\nmen and women with IGT or IFG into\ncontrol, medication (metformin), or life-\nstyle modiﬁcation groups, composed of\ndietary and weight loss goals and 150 min\nof weekly aerobic activity (149). Lifestyle\nmodiﬁcation in both studies reduced in-\ncident diabetes by 58% and, in the DPP,\nhad a greater effect than metformin\n(31%). Weight loss was the dominant\npredictor of a lower incidence, but in-\ncreased PA reduced risk of type 2 diabetes\neven when weight loss goals were not\nachieved (104,158,173). PA seems to\nplay a role in preventing type 2 diabetes\nacross ethnic groups and in both sexes\n(154,224).\nData show that moderate exercise\nsuch as brisk walking reduces risk of type\n2 diabetes (108,113,114,154,224), and\nall studies support the current recom-\nmendation of 2.5 h/week of a moderate\naerobic activity or typically 30 min/day\nfor 5 days/week for prevention. A meta-\nanalysis of 10 cohort studies (125) that\nassessed the preventive effects of moder-\nate-intensity PA found that risk reduction\nfor type 2 diabetes was 0.70 (0.58 – 0.84)\nfor walking on a regular basis (typically\nbriskly for/H113502.5 h/week). The preventive\neffects of resistance training have not been\nstudied.\nType 2 diabetes is also increasing in\nprevalence in children and adolescents,\nwith increasingly sedentary behavior and\nobesity as key contributors. No RCTs\nhave been completed that address\nwhether PA or exercise prevents type 2\ndiabetes in youth. However, limited stud-\nies suggest that, to prevent and manage\ntype 2 diabetes, goals for youth should\ninclude limiting daily screen time (televi-\nsion, computer, or video game) to less\nthan 60 min/day and doing at least 60\nmin/day of PA (188). A multicenter trial\n(the TODAY study) is currently underway\nto assess the role of PA as part of a behav-\nioral lifestyle intervention aimed at pre-\nventing type 2 diabetes in youth (254).\nColberg and Associates\ncare.diabetesjournals.org D IABETES CARE, VOLUME 33, NUMBER 12, DECEMBER 2010 e153\nDownloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/33/12/e147/604952/zdc0121000e147.pdf by guest on 04 December 2025\n\n\nEvidence statement. At least 2.5 h/week\nof moderate to vigorous PA should be un-\ndertaken as part of lifestyle changes to\nprevent type 2 diabetes onset in high-risk\nadults. ACSMevidence category A. ADA A\nlevel recommendation.\nPA AND PREVENTION AND\nCONTROL OF GDM— As the prev-\nalence of diabetes continues to rise worldwide,\nit becomes increasingly important to identify\nhigh-risk populations and to implement strat-\negies to delay or prevent diabetes onset.\nWomen diagnosed with GDM are at substan-\ntially increased risk of developing type 2 dia-\nbetes; therefore, PA may be considered a tool\nto prevent both GDM and possibly type 2 di-\nabetes at a later date (70). Prepregnancy PA\nhas been consistently associated with a re-\nduced risk of GDM (57,58,69,206, 290).\nStudies during pregnancy are sparse, with\nonly one case-control study (57), one retro-\nspective study (174), and one study of a co-\nhort of Hispanic women (37) observing\nsigniﬁcant protective effects of PA, while oth-\ners have not (58,69,206).\nEngaging in 30 min of moderate-\nintensity PA (e.g., brisk walking) during\nmost days of the week (e.g., 2.5 h/week)\nhas been adopted as a recommendation\nfor pregnant women without medical or\nobstetrical complications (222). How-\never, few primary prevention studies have\nexamined whether making a change in PA\nreduces risk of developing GDM. In 2006,\na meta-analysis reviewed four RCTs on\nGDM in which pregnant women in their\nthird trimester exercised on a cycle or arm\nergometer or performed resistance train-\ning three times a week for 20 – 45 min\ncompared with doing no speciﬁc program\n(36). The women involved in exercise had\nbetter BG control, lower fasting and post-\nprandial glucose concentrations, and im-\nproved cardiorespiratory ﬁtness,\nalthough frequency of prescription of in-\nsulin to control BG did not differ from\nnonexercisers, and pregnancy outcomes\nwere unchanged.\nEvidence statement. Epidemiological\nstudies suggest that higher levels of PA\nmay reduce risk of developing GDM dur-\ning pregnancy.ACSM evidence category C.\nRCTs suggest that moderate exercise may\nlower maternal BG levels in GDM.ACSM\nevidence category B.\nPREEXERCISE EVALUATION—\nSafe exercise participation can be compli-\ncated by the presence of diabetes-related\nhealth complications such as CVD, hyper-\ntension, neuropathy, or microvascular\nchanges (239). For individuals desiring to\nparticipate in low-intensity PA such as\nwalking, health care providers should use\nclinical judgment in deciding whether to\nrecommend preexercise testing (3). Con-\nducting exercise stress testing before\nwalking is unnecessary. No evidence sug-\ngests that it is routinely necessary as a\nCVD diagnostic tool, and requiring it may\ncreate barriers to participation.\nFor exercise more vigorous than brisk\nwalking or exceeding the demands of ev-\neryday living, sedentary and older dia-\nbetic individuals will likely beneﬁt from\nbeing assessed for conditions that might\nbe associated with risk of CVD, contrain-\ndicate certain activities, or predispose to\ninjuries, including severe peripheral neu-\nropathy, severe autonomic neuropathy,\nand preproliferative or proliferative reti-\nnopathy (240). Before undertaking new\nhigher-intensity PA, they are advised to\nundergo a detailed medical evaluation\nand screening for BG control, physical\nlimitations, medications, andmacrovascu-\nlar and microvascular complications (3).\nThis assessment may include a graded\nexercise test depending on the age of the\nperson, diabetes duration, and the pres-\nence of additional CVD risk factors\n(3,240). The prevalence of symptomatic\nand asymptomatic coronary artery dis-\nease (CAD) is greater in individuals with\ntype 2 diabetes (72,155), and maximal\ngraded exercise testing can identify a\nsmall proportion of asymptomatic per-\nsons with severe coronary artery obstruc-\ntion (52).\nMost young individuals with a low\nCAD risk may not beneﬁt from preexer-\ncise stress testing. In the Look AHEAD\ntrial, although exercise-induced abnor-\nmalities were present in 1,303 (22.5%)\nparticipants, only older age was associ-\nated with increased prevalence of all ab-\nnormalities during maximal testing (52).\nA systematic review of the U.S. Preventive\nServices Task Force (USPSTF) concluded\nthat stress testing should not be routinely\nrecommended to detect ischemia in\nasymptomatic individuals with a low\nCAD risk (/H1102110% risk of a cardiac event\nmore than 10 years) because the risks\nfrom invasive testing done after a false-\npositive test outweigh the beneﬁts of its\ndetection (79,262). The lower the CAD\nrisk, the higher the chance of a false pos-\nitive (79,248).\nCurrent guidelines attempt to avoid\nautomatic inclusion of lower-risk individ-\nuals with type 2 diabetes, stating that ex-\nercise stress testing is advised primarily\nfor previously sedentary individuals with\ndiabetes who want to undertake activity\nmore intense than brisk walking. The goal\nis to more effectively target individuals at\nhigher risk for underlying CVD (239).\nThe UKPDS Risk Engine (http://www.\ndtu.ox. ac.uk/riskengine/download.htm)\n(248) can also be used to calculate ex-\npected 10-year CV risk based on age, sex,\nsmoking, A1C, diabetes duration, lipids,\nBP, and race.\nIn general, electrocardiogram (ECG)\nstress testing may be indicated for indi-\nviduals matching one or more of these\ncriteria:\n● Age /H1102240 years, with or without CVD\nrisk factors other than diabetes\n● Age /H1102230 years and\n● Type 1 or type 2 diabetes of /H1102210\nyears in duration\n● Hypertension\n● Cigarette smoking\n● Dyslipidemia\n● Proliferative or preproliferative reti-\nnopathy\n● Nephropathy including microalbu-\nminuria\n● Any of the following, regardless of age\n● Known or suspected CAD, cerebro-\nvascular disease, and/or peripheral\nartery disease (PAD)\n● Autonomic neuropathy\n● Advanced nephropathy with renal\nfailure\nUse of these criteria does not exclude\nthe possibility of conducting ECG stress\ntesting on individuals with a low CAD risk\nor those who planning to engage in less\nintense exercise (248). In the absence of\ncontraindications to maximal stress test-\ning, it can still be considered for anyone\nwith type 2 diabetes. Although clinical ev-\nidence does not deﬁnitively determine\nwho should undergo such testing, poten-\ntial beneﬁts should be weighed against the\nrisk associated with unnecessary proce-\ndures for each individual (155,239).\nIn individuals with positive or non-\nspeciﬁc ECG changes in response to exer-\ncise, or with nonspeciﬁc ST- and T-wave\nchanges at rest, follow-up testing may be\nperformed (236). However, the DIAD\ntrial involving 1,123 individuals with\ntype 2 diabetes and no symptoms of CAD\nfound that screening with adenosine-\nstress radionuclide myocardial perfusion\nimaging for myocardial ischemia more\nthan 4.8 years did not alter rates of cardiac\nevents (288); thus, the cost-effectiveness\nand diagnostic value of more intensive\ntesting remains in question.\nExercise and type 2 diabetes\ne154 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 33, NUMBER 12, DECEMBER 2010 care.diabetesjournals.org\nDownloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/33/12/e147/604952/zdc0121000e147.pdf by guest on 04 December 2025\n\n\nThere is no evidence available to de-\ntermine whether preexercise evaluation\ninvolving stress testing is necessary or\nbeneﬁcial before participation in anaero-\nbic or resistance training. At present, most\ntesting centers are equipped for maximal\nstress testing but not for an alternate form\nof testing involving resistance exercise.\nMoreover, coronary ischemia is less likely\nto occur during resistance compared with\naerobic exercise eliciting the same heart\nrate (HR), and some doubt exists as to\nwhether resistance exercise induces isch-\nemia (77,88). A review of 12 studies of\nresistance exercise in men with known\nCAD found no angina, ST depression, ab-\nnormal hemodynamics, ventricular dys-\nrhythmias, or other complications during\nsuch exercise (275).\nEvidence statement. Before undertaking\nexercise more intense than brisk walking,\nsedentary persons with type 2 diabetes\nwill likely beneﬁt from an evaluation by a\nphysician. ECG exercise stress testing for\nasymptomatic individuals at low risk of\nCAD is not recommended but may be in-\ndicated for higher risk. ACSM evidence cat-\negory C . ADA C level recom-\nmendation.\nRECOMMENDED PA\nPARTICIPATION FOR\nPERSONS WITH TYPE 2\nDIABETES — Just 39% of adults with\ndiabetes are physically active compared\nwith 58% of other American adults (193).\nHowever, for most people with type 2 di-\nabetes, exercise is recommended for dia-\nbetes management and can be\nundertaken safely and effectively.\nAerobic exercise training\nFrequency. Aerobic exercise should be\nperformed at least 3 days/week with no\nmore than 2 consecutive days between\nbouts of activity because of the transient\nnature of exercise-induced improvements\nin insulin action (26,141). Most clinical\ntrials evaluating exercise interventions in\ntype 2 diabetes have used a frequency of\nthree times per week (24,238,246,255),\nbut current guidelines for adults generally\nrecommend ﬁve sessions of moderate ac-\ntivity (105,202,217).\nIntensity. Aerobic exercise should be at\nleast at moderate intensity, correspond-\ning approximately to 40 – 60% ofV\nO2max\n(maximal aerobic capacity). For most\npeople with type 2 diabetes, brisk walking\nis a moderate-intensity exercise. Addi-\ntional beneﬁts may be gained from vigor-\nous exercise (/H1102260% of V\nO2max). A meta-\nanalysis (25) showed that exercise\nintensity predicts improvements in over-\nall BG control to a greater extent than ex-\nercise volume, suggesting that those\nalready exercising at a moderate intensity\nshould consider undertaking some vigor-\nous PA to obtain additional BG (and likely\nCV) beneﬁts.\nDuration. Individuals with type 2 diabe-\ntes should engage in a minimum of 150\nmin/week of exercise undertaken at mod-\nerate intensity or greater. Aerobic activity\nshould be performed in bouts of at least\n10 min and be spread throughout the\nweek. Around 150 min/week of moder-\nate-intensity exercise is associated with\nreduced morbidity and mortality in ob-\nservational studies in all populations\n(217). The average weekly duration in\nmeta-analyses of exercise interventions in\ntype 2 diabetes (24,246,255), including\nhigher-intensity aerobic exercise (196),\nhas been in a similar range. Recent joint\nACSM/American Heart Association\nguidelines (105,202) recommended 150\nmin of moderate activity (30 min, 5 days/\nweek) or 60 min of vigorous PA (20 min\non 3 days) for all adults, whereas recent\nU.S. federal guidelines (217) recom-\nmended 150 min of moderate or 75 min\nof vigorous activity, or an equivalent com-\nbination, spread throughout each week.\nThe U.S. federal guidelines (217) sug-\ngest that an exercise volume of 500 –\n1,000 MET /H18528min/week (MET equivalent\nof PA /H11003number of minutes) is optimal\nand can be achieved, for example, with\n150 min/week of walking at 6.4 km/h (4\nmph; intensity of 5 METs) or 75 min of\njogging at 9.6 km/h (6 mph; 10 METs).\nUnfortunately, most people with type 2\ndiabetes do not have sufﬁcient aerobic ca-\npacity to jog at 9.6 km/h for that weekly\nduration, and they may have orthopedic\nor other limitations. In a meta-analysis,\nthe mean maximal aerobic capacity in di-\nabetic individuals was only 22.4 ml/kg/\nmin, or 6.4 METs (25), making 4.8 METs\n(75% of maximal) the highest sustainable\nintensity. Therefore, most diabetic indi-\nviduals will require at least 150 min of\nmoderate to vigorous aerobic exercise per\nweek to achieve optimal CVD risk reduc-\ntion. Some CV and BG beneﬁts may be\ngained from lower exercise volumes (a\nminimum dose has not been established),\nwhereas further beneﬁt likely results from\nengaging in durations beyond recom-\nmended amounts. Individuals with\nhigher aerobic capacities ( /H1102210 METs)\nmay be able to exercise at a higher abso-\nlute intensity for less time and achieve the\nsame beneﬁts.\nMode. Any form of aerobic exercise (in-\ncluding brisk walking) that uses large\nmuscle groups and causes sustained in-\ncreases in HR is likely to be beneﬁcial\n(114), and undertaking a variety of modes\nof PA is recommended (217).\nRate of progression. At present, no\nstudy on individuals with type 2 diabetes\nhas compared rates of progression in ex-\nercise intensity or volume. Gradual pro-\ngression of both is advisable to minimize\nthe risk of injury, particularly if health\ncomplications are present, and to en-\nhance compliance.\nBody weight loss and maintenance.\nThe most successful weight control pro-\ngrams involve combinations of exercise,\ndiet, and behavior modiﬁcation. People\nwho successfully maintain a large weight\nloss report exercising about 7 h/week\n(62,212,234,235,274).\nEvidence statement. Persons with type 2\ndiabetes should undertake at least 150\nmin/week of moderate to vigorous aero-\nbic exercise spread out during at least 3\ndays during the week, with no more than\n2 consecutive days between bouts of aer-\nobic activity. ACSM evidence category B.\nADA B level recommendation.\nResistance exercise training\nFrequency. Resistance exercise should\nbe undertaken at least twice weekly on\nnonconsecutive days (1,105,202,217,\n239,240), but more ideally three times a\nweek (65,246), as part of a PA program\nfor individuals with type 2 diabetes, along\nwith regular aerobic activities.\nIntensity. Training should be moderate\n(50% of 1-repetition maximum [1-RM])\nor vigorous (75– 80% of 1-RM) for opti-\nmal gains in strength and insulin action\n(1,97,239,240,263). Home-based resis-\ntance training following supervised, gym-\nbased training may be less effective for\nmaintaining BG control but adequate for\nmaintaining muscle mass and strength\n(66).\nDuration. Each training session should\nminimally include 5–10 exercises involv-\ning the major muscle groups (in the upper\nbody, lower body, and core) and involve\ncompletion of 10 –15 repetitions to near\nfatigue per set early in training (1,\n97,239,240,263), progressing over time to\nheavier weights (or resistance) that can be\nlifted only 8 –10 times. A minimum of one set\nof repetitions to near fatigue, but as many as\nthree to four sets, is recommended for optimal\nstrength gains.\nColberg and Associates\ncare.diabetesjournals.org D IABETES CARE, VOLUME 33, NUMBER 12, DECEMBER 2010 e155\nDownloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/33/12/e147/604952/zdc0121000e147.pdf by guest on 04 December 2025\n\n\nMode. Resistance machines and free\nweights (e.g., dumbbells and barbells)\ncan result in fairly equivalent gains in\nstrength and mass of targeted muscles\n(66). Heavier weights or resistance may\nbe needed for optimization of insulin ac-\ntion and BG control (276).\nRate of progression. To avoid injury,\nprogression of intensity, frequency, and\nduration of training sessions should occur\nslowly. In most progressive training, in-\ncreases in weight or resistance are under-\ntaken ﬁrst and only once when the target\nnumber of repetitions per set can consis-\ntently be exceeded, followed by a greater\nnumber of sets and lastly by increased\ntraining frequency. Progression for 6\nmonths to thrice-weekly sessions of three\nsets of 8 –10 repetitions done at 75 to 80%\nof 1-RM on 8 –10 exercises may be an op-\ntimal goal (65).\nEvidence statement. In addition to aero-\nbic training, persons with type 2 diabetes\nshould undertake moderate to vigorous\nresistance training at least 2–3 days/week.\nACSM evidence category B. ADA B level\nrecommendation.\nSupervised training\nInitial instruction and periodic supervi-\nsion by a qualiﬁed exercise trainer is rec-\nommended for most persons with type 2\ndiabetes, particularly if they undertake re-\nsistance exercise training, to ensure opti-\nmal beneﬁts to BG control, BP, lipids, and\nCV risk and to minimize injury risk (11).\nCombined aerobic and resistance\nand other types of training\nInclusion of both aerobic and resistance\nexercise training is recommended. Com-\nbined training thrice weekly in individu-\nals with type 2 diabetes may be of greater\nbeneﬁt to BG control than either aerobic\nor resistance exercise alone (238). How-\never, the total duration of exercise and\ncaloric expenditure was greatest with\ncombined training in all studies done to\ndate (51,183,238), and both types of\ntraining were undertaken together on the\nsame days. No studies have yet reported\nwhether daily, but alternating, training is\nmore effective or the BG effect of isoca-\nloric combinations of training. Milder\nforms of PA, such as yoga and tai chi, may\nbeneﬁt control of BG (98,117,269,\n286,291), although their inclusion is not\nsupported conclusively at this time.\nDaily movement (unstructured\nactivity)\nIndividuals with type 2 diabetes are en-\ncouraged to increase their total daily, un-\nstructured PA to gain additional health\nbeneﬁts. Nonexercise activity thermogen-\nesis (i.e., energy expending for activities\nof daily living) can create a large daily ca-\nloric deﬁcit to prevent excessive weight\ngain (168,169). In an observational\nstudy, obese individuals sat for about\n2.5 h more and walked an average of 3.5\nmiles/day or less than their lean counter-\nparts do. Most of the lean subjects’ greater\nactivity came from walks of short dura-\ntion (/H1102115 min) and low velocity (/H110111\nmph) (168).\nMoreover, use of objective measures\nsuch as step counters may enhance reach-\ning daily goals. A meta-analysis of 26\nstudies with a total of 2,767 (primarily\nnondiabetic) participants (8 RCTs and 18\nobservational studies) found that pedom-\neter users increased PA by 26.9% over\nbaseline in studies having an average in-\ntervention of 18 weeks (30). An impor-\ntant predictor of increased PA was the use\nof a goal, such as to take 10,000 steps per\nday (30).\nFlexibility training\nFlexibility training may be included as\npart of a PA program, although it should\nnot substitute for other training. Older\nadults are advised to undertake exercises\nthat maintain or improve balance\n(202,217), which may include some ﬂex-\nibility training, particularly for many\nolder individuals with type 2 diabetes\nwith a higher risk of falling (194). Al-\nthough ﬂexibility exercise (stretching)\nhas frequently been recommended as a\nmeans of increasing joint range of motion\n(ROM) and reducing risk of injury, two\nsystematic reviews found that ﬂexibility\nexercise does not reduce risk of exercise-\ninduced injury (237,287). A small RCT\nfound that ROM exercises modestly de-\ncreased peak plantar pressures (94), but\nno study has directly evaluated whether\nsuch training reduces risk of ulceration or\ninjury in type 2 diabetes. However, ﬂexi-\nbility exercise combined with resistance\ntraining can increase ROM in individuals\nwith type 2 diabetes (109) and allow in-\ndividuals to more easily engage in activi-\nties that require greater ROM around\njoints.\nEvidence statement. Supervised and\ncombined aerobic and resistance training\nmay confer health additional beneﬁts, al-\nthough milder forms of PA (such as yoga)\nhave shown mixed results. Persons with\ntype 2 diabetes are encouraged to increase\ntheir total daily unstructured PA. Flexibil-\nity training may be included but should\nnot be undertaken in place of other rec-\nommended types of PA. ACSM evidence\ncategory B.

While hyperglycemia\ncan be worsened by exercise in type 1 di-\nabetic individuals who are insulin deﬁ-\ncient and ketotic (due to missed or\ninsufﬁcient insulin), very few persons\nwith type 2 diabetes develop such a pro-\nfound degree of insulin deﬁciency. There-\nfore, individuals with type 2 diabetes\ngenerally do not need to postpone exer-\ncise because of high BG, provided that\nthey are feeling well. If they undertake\nstrenuous physical activities with elevated\nglucose levels ( /H11022300 mg/dl or 16.7\nmmol/l), it is prudent to ensure that they\nare adequately hydrated (3). If hypergly-\ncemic after a meal, individuals with type 2\ndiabetes will still likely experience a re-\nduction in BG during aerobic work be-\ncause endogenous insulin levels will\nlikely be higher at that time (221).\nEvidence statement. Individuals with\ntype 2 diabetes may engage in PA, using\ncaution when exercising with BG levels\nexceeding 300 mg/dl (16.7 mmol/l) with-\nout ketosis, provided they are feeling well\nand are adequately hydrated. ACSM\nevidence category C . ADA E level\nrecommendation.\nHypoglycemia: causes and prevention.\nOf greatest concern to many exercisers is\nthe risk of hypoglycemia. In individuals\nwhose diabetes is being controlled by life-\nstyle alone, the risk of developing hypo-\nglycemia during exercise is minimal,\nmaking stringent measures unnecessary\nto maintain BG (239). Glucose monitor-\ning can be performed before and after PA\nto assess its unique effect. Activities of\nlonger duration and lower intensity\ngenerally cause a decline in BG levels but\nnot to the level of hypoglycemia\n(9,29,75,111,160). While very intense\nactivities can cause transient elevations in\nBG (156,252,253), intermittent high-\nintensity exercise done immediately after\nbreakfast in individuals treated with diet\nonly reduces BG levels and insulin secre-\ntion (160).\nIn insulin or insulin secretagogue us-\ners, who frequently have the effects of\nboth exercise and insulin to increase glu-\ncose uptake, PA can complicate diabetes\nExercise and type 2 diabetes\ne156 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 33, NUMBER 12, DECEMBER 2010 care.diabetesjournals.org\nDownloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/33/12/e147/604952/zdc0121000e147.pdf by guest on 04 December 2025\n\n\nmanagement (138,198,230,293). For\npreexercise BG levels of less than 100\nmg/dl (5.5 mmol/l), ADA recommends\nthat carbohydrate be ingested before any\nPA (3), but this applies only to individuals\ntaking insulin or the secretagogues more\nlikely to cause hypoglycemia (e.g., sulfo-\nnylureas such as glyburide, glipizide, and\nglimepiride, as well as nateglinide and re-\npaglinide) (161,230). If controlled with\ndiet or other oral medications, most indi-\nviduals will not need carbohydrate sup-\nplements for exercise lasting less than an\nhour. Insulin users should likely consume\nup to 15 g of carbohydrate before exercise\nfor an initial BG level of 100 mg/dl or\nlower, with the actual amount dependent\non injected insulin doses, exercise dura-\ntion and intensity, and results of BG mon-\nitoring. Intense, short exercise requires\nlesser or no carbohydrate intake (156).\nLater-onset hypoglycemia is a greater\nconcern when carbohydrate stores (i.e.,\nmuscle and liver glycogen) are depleted\nduring an acute bout of exercise. In par-\nticular, high-intensity exercise (e.g., re-\npeated interval or intense resistance\ntraining) can result in substantial deple-\ntion of muscle glycogen, thereby increas-\ning risk for postexercise hypoglycemia in\nusers of insulin or insulin secretagogues\n(161). In such cases, the consumption of\n5–30 g of carbohydrate during and within\n30 min after exhaustive, glycogen-\ndepleting exercise will lower hypoglyce-\nmia risk and allow for more efﬁcient\nrestoration of muscle glycogen (31,247).\nEvidence statement. Persons with type 2\ndiabetes not using insulin or insulin\nsecretagogues are unlikely to experience\nhypoglycemia related to PA. Users of in-\nsulin and insulin secretagogues are ad-\nvised to supplement with carbohydrate as\nneeded to prevent hypoglycemia during\nand after exercise.ACSM evidence category\nC. ADA C level recommendation.\nMEDICATION EFFECTS ON\nEXERCISE RESPONSES— Current\ntreatment strategies promote combina-\ntion therapies to address the three major\ndefects in type 2 diabetes: impaired pe-\nripheral glucose uptake (liver, fat, and\nmuscle), excessive hepatic glucose release\n(with glucagon excess), and insufﬁcient\ninsulin secretion. Medication adjust-\nments for PA are generally necessary only\nwith use of insulin and other insulin\nsecretagogues (161,230). To prevent hy-\npoglycemia, individuals may need to re-\nduce their oral medications or insulin\ndosing before (and possibly after) exercise\n(83,161). Before planned exercise, short-\nacting insulin doses will likely have to be\nreduced to prevent hypoglycemia.\nNewer, synthetic, rapid-acting insulin an-\nalogs (i.e., lispro, aspart, and glulisine) in-\nduce more rapid decreases in BG than\nregular human insulin. Individuals will\nneed to monitor BG levels before, occa-\nsionally during, and after exercise and\ncompensate with appropriate dietary\nand/or medication regimen changes, par-\nticularly when exercising at insulin peak\ntimes. If only longer-acting insulins such\nas glargine, detemir, and NPH are being\nabsorbed from subcutaneous depots dur-\ning PA, exercise-induced hypoglycemia is\nnot as likely (219), although doses may\nneed to be reduced to accommodate reg-\nular participation in PA. Doses of select\noral hypoglycemic agents (glyburide,\nglipizide, glimepiride, nateglinide, and\nrepaglinide) may also need to be lowered\nin response to regular exercise training if\nthe frequency of hypoglycemia increases\n(161,230).\nDiabetic individuals are often pre-\nscribed a variety of medications for co-\nmorbid conditions, including diuretics,\n/H9252-blockers, ACE inhibitors, aspirin, lipid-\nlowering agents, and more. These medi-\ncations generally do not affect exercise\nresponses, with some notable exceptions.\n/H9252-Blockers are known to blunt HR re-\nsponses to exercise and lower maximal\nexercise capacity to/H1101187% of expected via\nnegative inotropic and chronotropic\neffects (241). They may also block adren-\nergic symptoms of hypoglycemia, in-\ncreasing the risk of undetected\nhypoglycemia during exercise. However,\n/H9252-blockers may increase exercise capacity\nin those with CAD, rather than lowering\nit, by reducing coronary ischemia during\nactivity (53). Diuretics, however, may\nlower overall blood and ﬂuid volumes re-\nsulting in dehydration and electrolyte im-\nbalances, particularly during exercise in\nthe heat.

Medication dosage\nadjustments to prevent exercise-\nassociated hypoglycemia may be required\nby individuals using insulin or certain in-\nsulin secretagogues. Most other medica-\ntions prescribed for concomitant health\nproblems do not affect exercise, with the\nexception of /H9252-blockers, some diuretics,\nand statins. ACSM evidence category C .\nADA C level recommendation.\nEXERCISE WITH LONG-\nTERM COMPLICATIONS OF\nDIABETES\nVascular disease. Individuals with an-\ngina and type 2 diabetes classiﬁed as mod-\nerate or high risk should preferably\nexercise in a supervised cardiac rehabili-\ntation program, at least initially (245).\nDiabetes accelerates the development of\natherosclerosis and is a major risk factor\nfor CVD and PAD. Individuals with type\n2 diabetes have a lifetime risk of CAD\nthat includes 67% of women and 78% of\nmen and is exacerbated by obesity\n(22,80,165). Moreover, some individuals\nwho have an acute myocardial infarction\nmay not experience chest pain, and up to\na third may have silent myocardial isch-\nemia (45,180).\nFor individuals with PAD, with and\nwithout intermittent claudication and\npain in the extremities during PA, low-to-\nmoderate walking, arm-crank, and cycling\nexercise have all been shown to enhance\nmobility, functional capacity, exercise pain\ntolerance, and QOL (214,295). Lower ex-\ntremity resistance training also improves\nfunctional performance measured by tread-\nmill walking, stair climbing ability, and\nQOL measures (187).\nVascular alterations are common in\ndiabetes, even in the absence of overt vas-\ncular disease. Endothelial dysfunction\nmay be an underlying cause of many as-\nsociated vascular problems (45,54). In\naddition to traditional risk factors, hyper-\nglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and oxida-\ntive stress contribute to endothelial\ndamage, leading to poor arterial function\nand greater susceptibility to atherogenesis\n(45,82,289). Both aerobic and resistance\ntraining can improve endothelial function\n(46,294), but not all studies have shown\nposttraining improvement (283).\nEvidence statement.

All individuals should\nclosely examine their feet on a daily basis\nto prevent and detect sores or ulcers early\nand follow recommendations for use of\nproper footwear. Previous guidelines\nstated that persons with severe peripheral\nneuropathy should avoid weight-bearing\nactivities to reduce risk of foot ulcerations\n(102,264). However, recent studies indi-\ncated that moderate walking does not in-\ncrease risk of foot ulcers or reulceration in\nthose with peripheral neuropathy\n(166,167).\nPeripheral neuropathy affects the ex-\ntremities, particularly the lower legs and\nfeet. Hyperglycemia causes nerve toxicity,\nleading to nerve damage and apoptosis\n(242,244), which causes microvascular\ndamage and loss of perfusion. Symptoms\nmanifest as neuropathic pain and/or loss\nof sensation that, coupled with poor\nblood ﬂow, increase the risk of foot inju-\nries and ulcerations (45,244). Up to 40%\nof diabetic individuals may experience\nperipheral neuropathy, and 60% of lower\nextremity amputations in Americans are\nrelated to diabetes (166,199,216).\nEvidence statement. Individuals with\nperipheral neuropathy and without acute\nulceration may participate in moderate\nweight-bearing exercise.

Moderate-\nintensity aerobic training can improve au-\ntonomic function in individuals with and\nwithout CV autonomic neuropathy\n(CAN) (112,176,208); however, im-\nprovements may only be evident after an\nacute submaximal exercise (78). Screen-\ning for CAN should include a battery of\nautonomic tests (including HR variabil-\nity) that evaluate both branches of the au-\ntonomic nervous system. Given the\nlikelihood of silent ischemia, HR, and BP\nabnormalities, individuals with CAN\nshould have physician approval and pos-\nsibly undergo stress testing to screen for\nCV abnormalities before commencing ex-\nercise (265). Exercise intensity may be ac-\ncurately prescribed using the HR reserve\nmethod (a percentage of the difference be-\ntween maximal and resting HR, added to\nthe resting value) to approximate oxygen\nconsumption during submaximal exer-\ncise with maximal HR directly measured,\nrather than estimated, for better accuracy\n(48,265).\nApproximately 22% of those with\ntype 2 diabetes have CAN, but most ex-\nhibit alterations in autonomic function\n(292). The presence of CAN doubles the\nrisk of mortality (48,265) and indicates\nmore frequency of silent myocardial isch-\nemia (265), orthostatic hypotension, or\nresting tachycardia (76,177). CAN also\nimpairs exercise tolerance and lowers\nmaximal HR (131,265). Although both\nsympathetic and parasympathetic dys-\nfunctions can be present, vagal dysfunc-\ntion usually occurs earlier. Slower HR\nrecovery after PA is associated with mor-\ntality risk (38,265).\nEvidence statement. Individuals with\nCAN should be screened and receive phy-\nsician approval and possibly an exercise\nstress test before exercise initiation.

Dia-\nbetic retinopathy is the main cause of\nblindness in developed countries and is\nassociated with increased CV mortality\n(129,147). Individuals with retinopathy\nmay receive some beneﬁts, such as im-\nproved work capacity, after low- to mod-\nerate-intensity exercise training (16,17).\nWhile PA has been shown to be protective\nagainst development of age-related mac-\nular degeneration (150), very little re-\nsearch exists in type 2 diabetes.\nEvidence statement.

ACSM evidence category D .\nADA E level recommendation.\nNephropathy and microalbuminuria.\nBoth aerobic and resistance training im-\nprove physical function and QOL in indi-\nviduals with kidney disease (126,209,\n210), although BP increases during PA\nmay transiently elevate levels of mi-\ncroalbumin in urine. Resistance exercise\ntraining is especially effective in improv-\ning muscle function and activities of daily\nliving, which are normally severely af-\nfected by later-stage kidney disease (126).\nBefore initiation of PA, individuals with\novert nephropathy should be carefully\nscreened, have physician approval, and\npossibly undergo stress testing to detect\nCAD and abnormal HR and BP responses\n(1,27). Exercise should be begun at a low\nintensity and volume because aerobic ca-\npacity and muscle function are substan-\ntially reduced, and avoidance of the\nValsava maneuver or high-intensity exer-\ncise to prevent excessive increases in BP is\nadvised (1). Supervised, moderate aero-\nbic exercise undertaken during dialysis\nsessions, however, has been shown to be\neffective as home-based exercise and may\nimprove compliance (126,151).\nDiabetic nephropathy develops in\n/H1101130% of individuals with diabetes and is\na major risk factor for death in those with\ndiabetes (20,45). Microalbuminuria, or\nminute amounts of albumin in the urine,\nis common and a risk factor for overt ne-\nphropathy (45) and CV mortality (91).\nTight BG and BP control may delay pro-\ngression of microalbuminuria (127,148),\nalong with exercise and dietary changes\n(81,162). Exercise training delays the\nprogression of diabetic nephropathy in\nanimals (89,259), but few evidence is\navailable in humans.\nEvidence statement. Exercise training\nincreases physical function and QOL in\nindividuals with kidney disease and may\neven be undertaken during dialysis ses-\nsions.

Additional\nstrategies are needed to increase the adop-\ntion and maintenance of PA.\nOne of the most consistent predictors\nof greater levels of activity has been higher\nlevels of self-efﬁcacy (2,55,68), which re-\nﬂect conﬁdence in the ability to exercise\n(185). Social support has also been asso-\nciated with greater levels of PA (93,\n190,215), supporting the role of social\nnetworks in the spread of obesity (41).\nExercise and type 2 diabetes\ne158 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 33, NUMBER 12, DECEMBER 2010 care.diabetesjournals.org\nDownloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/33/12/e147/604952/zdc0121000e147.pdf by guest on 04 December 2025\n\n\nFortunately, those same social dynamics\nmay be exploited to increase the effects of\ninterventions beyond the “target” individ-\nual (8,99) and potentially can help spread\nPA behavior. Counseling delivered by\nhealth care professionals may be a mean-\ningful source of support and effective\nsource for delivery (7,144). Physicians\nvary in counseling their patients to exer-\ncise: on average, advice or referral related\nto exercise occurred at 18% of ofﬁce visits\namong diabetic patients (213), and 73%\nof patients reported receiving advice at\nsome point to exercise more (192). The\navailability of facilities or pleasant and\nsafe places to walk may also be important\npredictors of regular PA (59).\nWhen prescribing PA for the preven-\ntion or control of type 2 diabetes, the ef-\nfects of the dose of the prescription on\nadherence are small (225). Therefore,\npractitioners are encouraged to use fac-\ntors such as choice and enjoyment in\nhelping determine speciﬁcally how an in-\ndividual would meet recommended par-\nticipation. Affective responses to exercise\nmay be important predictors of adoption\nand maintenance, and encouraging activ-\nity at intensities below the ventilatory\nthreshold may be most beneﬁcial\n(172,277,278). Many individuals with, or\nat risk of developing, type 2 diabetes pre-\nfer walking as an aerobic activity (190),\nand pedometer-based interventions can\nbe effective for increasing aerobic activity\n(30,205,258). Finally, the emerging im-\nportance of sedentary behaviors in deter-\nmining metabolic risk (106,107) suggests\nthat future interventions may also beneﬁt\nfrom attempting to decrease sitting time\nand periods of extended sedentary\nactivity.\nLarge-scale trials such as the DPP and\nLook AHEAD provide some insight into\nsuccessful lifestyle interventions that help\npromote PA by incorporating goal setting,\nself-monitoring, frequent contact, and\nstepped-care protocols (56,60,71,266).\nDelivering these programs requires exten-\nsive access to resources, staff, and space,\nalthough they are cost-effective overall\n(121,122).\nThese large studies are multifactorial,\ntargeting several behaviors that include\nPA, but include multiple behavior inter-\nventions that also require changes in diet\nand focusing on weight loss or manage-\nment (179). Therefore, strategies for PA\nintervention in weight management are\nhighly relevant to this population (62).\nFewer RCTs solely targeted PA behavior\nin individuals with or at risk of develop-\ning type 2 diabetes (279,284,285). The\nresults have been mixed, with some\nshowing increased PA (67,120,145,171)\nand others showing no effect\n(142,143,189). Effective short-term pro-\ngrams have used print (67), phone\n(44,144,233), in-person (120,139), or\nInternet (92,171) delivery. Long-term ef-\nfectiveness of such interventions has not\nbeen assessed (197).\nEvidence statement. Efforts to promote\nPA should focus on developing self-\nefﬁcacy and fostering social support from\nfamily, friends, and health care providers.\nEncouraging mild or moderate PA may be\nmost beneﬁcial to adoption and mainte-\nnance of regular PA participation.
