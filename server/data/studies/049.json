    "introduction": "The combination of resistance training (RT) with dietary\napproaches is acknowledged as an effective strategy to\nimprove body composition (Bagheri, Hooshmand\nMoghadam, et al. 2021; Haghighat et al. 2020b; Lasevicius\net al. 2018). Indeed, numerous studies have demonstrated\nthe influence of diverse macronutrient ratios on body com-\nposition in resistance-trained populations (Antonio et al.\n2015; Antonio et al. 2016; Aragon et al. 2017; Wycherley\net al. 2010). Existing sports nutrition guidelines propose\ncarbohydrate-based or periodized carbohydrate-based diets\nto augment athletic performance and muscular adaptations\nto RT (Burke et al. 2011; Jeukendrup 2017; Kerksick et al.\n2018; Thomas, Erdman, and Burke 2016). However, in the\nlast decades, there has been a surge in the popularity of\nlow-carbohydrate and high-fat approaches such as the keto-\ngenic diet (KD), largely due to purported benefits for body\ncomposition (Paoli, Bianco, and Grimaldi2015; Tinsley and\nWilloughby 2016). KD is commonly characterized by\ndecreasing carbohydrate intake to a maximum of approxi-\nmately 50 g/d, or 5% of daily energy intake, while protein\nconsumption is moderate or high (e.g. /C25 1.2 to 1.5 g/kg/d).\nThe remaining energy intake is predominantly from fats\n(/C25 60– 80%), with relative fat intake depending on the degree\nof displacement of carbohydrates and proteins (Aragon et al.\n2017). This macronutrient distribution leads to an increase\nin the production of ketone bodies (KB), such as acetoace-\ntate, b-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone, and consequently to\nthe state of physiological ketosis (i.e., elevated KB concentra-\ntions in the plasma as compared to a mixed diet) (Hall et al.\n2016; Paoli and Health 2014). Some investigations have\nhighlighted the efficacy of low-carbohydrate diets, including\nKD, in reducing body mass (BM) and fat mass (FM) as\ncompared to other calorie-restricted diets (Krieger et al.\n2006; Volek et al.2004). A previous meta-analysis indicated\nthat individuals assigned to a KD experienced greater BM\nloss than those assigned to a low-fat diet (LFD) for up to\none year (Bueno et al.2013). In addition to the investigation\nas a dietary intervention to combat overweight and obesity,\nketogenic diets (KDs) have received increasing attention\namong normal-weight adults and those with esthetic goals,\nincluding resistance-trained individuals (Kang et al.2020).\nCONTACT Alexei Wong awong@marymount.edu Department of Health and Human Performance, Marymount University, Arlington, TX; Reza Bagheri\nWill.fivb@yahoo.com Department of Exercise Physiology, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran\nSupplemental data for this article can be accessed athttps://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2021.1890689.\n/C2232021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC\nCRITICAL REVIEWS IN FOOD SCIENCE AND NUTRITION\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2021.1890689\n\nIt is recognized that RT is partially dependent upon\nmuscle glycogen stores as a form of energy supply\n(Cholewa, Newmire, and Zanchi 2019; Haff et al. 2003).\nCarbohydrate intake and consequent intramuscular glycogen\nconcentrations play a critical role in the energy status and\nintracellular signaling pathways, namely by influencing the\nactivity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)\n(Aschenbach, Sakamoto, and Goodyear 2004; Escobar,\nVanDusseldorp, and Kerksick 2016; Hawley et al. 2011;\nHawley, Tipton, and Millard-Stafford 2006; McBride et al.\n2009), which is a key factor that limits muscle size and cap-\nacity for hypertrophy and promotes muscle atrophy\n(Thomson 2018). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that\nKDs (Paoli, Bianco, and Grimaldi 2015) and low-glycogen\nconcentrations (Aschenbach, Sakamoto, and Goodyear2004;\nHawley et al. 2011; Wojtaszewski et al. 2003) may result in\nup-regulated AMPK activity, which in turn attenuates the\nTuberous Sclerosis 1 (TSC1) while increases Tuberous\nSclerosis 2 (TSC2) activity (Laplante and Sabatini 2009).\nUltimately, these changes would lead to the downregulation\nof the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1\n(mTORC1) activity, thereby decreasing muscle protein syn-\nthesis (MPS) rates (Dreyer et al.2006; Wilkinson et al.2008;\nXu, Ji, and Yan2012). Furthermore, KDs can be considered\nrapid BM loss diets in some instances, (Harvey, Holcomb,\nand Kolwicz 2019; Masood, Annamaraju, and Uppaluri\n2020; Muscogiuri et al. 2019; Oh and Uppaluri 2020) and\nthere is a limited amount of evidence indicating that fat-free\nmass (FFM) loss may be a consequence of rapid loss of BM\n(Ashtary-Larky, et al. 2018; Ashtary-Larky, et al. 2017;\nBagheri, Ashtary-Larky, et al. 2021). However, it is also\nacknowledged that the early, more rapid BM loss with a KD\nis related to loss of glycogen stores and associated water\nweight (Tinsley and Willoughby2016). On the other hand, a\nKD can contain moderate to high protein content (approxi-\nmately 30 – 35% of daily calorie intake), (Masood,\nAnnamaraju, and Uppaluri2020) which is an important fac-\ntor for RT-based muscular hypertrophic adaptations\n(Bagheri, Hooshmand Moghadam, et al.2021; Bagheri et al.\n2020). Moreover, it has been recently shown that a high\nprotein diet could preserve muscle mass during BM and/or\nfat loss phase (Haghighat et al. 2020; Johnston et al. 2017;\nKim et al. 2016; Luger et al. 2013; Mettler, Mitchell, and\nTipton 2010). The conceivable FFM-preserving mechanism\nof high protein diets can be related to dietary protein-\ninduced alterations in protein turnover, particularly MPS,\ninhibiting AMPK phosphorylation, and activating mTORC1\nsignaling (Cuthbertson et al.2005\n; Fujita et al.2007; Krieger\net al. 2006; Pasiakos et al. 2013). Accordingly, the question\nas to whether and how KD could affect FFM in those per-\nforming RT remains unclear.\nIt has been hypothesized that KDs lead to greater BM\nand FM loss while maintaining FFM (Manninen and\nMetabolism 2006), and therefore these diets may effectively\nimprove body composition in individuals who participate in\nRT. However, the general impact of KD on body compos-\nition changes in resistance-trained individuals is unsettled\nand has varied in prior investigations, demonstrating a need\nfor a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of\nrandomized controlled trials (RCTs) on this topic.\nTherefore, we aimed to conduct a systematic review and\nmeta-analysis of the pooled data from RCTs to compare the\nefficacy of KDs in individuals performing RT on body com-\nposition variables, including BM, body mass index (BMI),\nFM, FFM, and body fat percentage (BFP).",
    "materials and methods": "Search strategy\nOur meta-analysis was carried out in accordance with the\nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and\nMeta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement (Moher et al. 2010).\nThe participants (age > 16 yr), intervention (KD), compari-\nson (non-KD control group), outcome (body composition)\n(PICOS) model was used and included BM, BMI, FFM,\nBFP, and FM measures collected from RCTs. Briefly,\nincluded studies were RCTs with a pre-post design that\nreported outcomes of a KD intervention greater than two\nweeks in duration, as compared to a non-KD, in individu-\nals > 16 yr. The following scientific databases were\nsearched up to 3 February 2021 with no limitation on time\nand language in six databases, including PubMed, the\nCochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, SCOPUS, and\nOvid. Our search strategy consisted of the following key-\nwords: \"ketogenic diet\", \"very low-carbohydrate diet, keto-\nadaptation\", \"VLCD\", \"KD\", \"ketosis\", \"high fat diet\", \"low\ncarbohydrate diet\", \"carbohydrate-restricted diet\", \"resistance\ntraining\", \"strength training\", \"weight training\", \"Pilates\",\n\"CrossFit\", \"exercise, athletes\", \"body composition\",\n\"anthropometric indices\", \"weight loss\", \"fat loss\", \"fat-free\nmass\", \"muscle mass\", \"muscle adaptation\", and \"perform-\nance\". In addition, to minimize the risk of missing any\nrelevant trials, all reference lists of the included studies and\nprevious review articles were searched.\nStudy selection and eligibility criteria\nThe title and abstract of all articles found in the initial\nsearch were evaluated independently by two authors (WK\nand RA). Articles were included in the present meta-analysis\nif they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) parallel and\ncrossover trials; (2) investigated the impact of KD (< 50 g/d,\nor < 5% of daily energy intake) on body composition meas-\nures including BM, BMI, FFM, BFP, and FM; (3) presented\noutcome data of interest as mean and standard deviation\n(SD) in both intervention and control groups; and (4) had a\ntrial duration of more than 2 weeks. RCTs that did not meet\nthe eligibility criteria were excluded via screening title,\nabstract, and full-text review. Exclusion criteria were: (1) All\nstudies that supplemented another compound combined\nwith KD in the intervention group; (2) animal, review, and\nexperimental studies; (3) studies without a control group; 4)\nstudies performed on children (<16 yr) (Clark, Tobias, and\nNess 2006) and pregnant or lactating women.\n2 D. ASHTARY-LARKY ET AL.\n\nData extraction\nTwo authors (DAL and AB) extracted data from eligible\nRCTs: (1) the first author’s last name, and year of publica-\ntion; (2) trial design as crossover or parallel randomized\ncontrolled trial (RCT); (3) age, BMI, and the number of par-\nticipants; (4) trial duration, (5) training intervention. In add-\nition, the mean and SD of anthropometric measures before\nand after intervention were extracted. Any reported standard\nerror of the mean (SEM) was converted to standard devia-\ntions (SDs) through the following formula by SD¼SEM /C2\n/H20881n (n is the number of participants in each group).\nQuality assessment\nA systematic assessment of bias in the included studies was\nperformed using the Cochrane criteria (Higgins et al.2011).\nThe quality of all included RCTs was evaluated by two\nauthors (DAL and RB) for the following items: selection\nbias (adequacy of sequence generation and allocation con-\ncealment), flawed outcome data (dropouts), detection (blind-\ning), reporting bias (selective outcome reporting), and other\npossible causes of bias. Based on The Cochrane Handbook\nrecommendation, studies were ranked as low (L), or high\nrisk of bias (H) or unclear (U) regarding each field of bias\n(Moher et al.2010).\nStatistical analysis\nMean change and SD for BM, BMI, FFM, BFP, and FM\nmeasures in the intervention and placebo groups were used\nto calculate the effect size. For studies with no reported SD\nof the mean difference, the following formula was used\n(Borenstein et al.2011):\nSDChange ¼\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\nððSDBaselineÞ2 þ SDFinalðÞ 2Þ/C0ð 2 /C2 0:8 /C2 SDBaseline /C2 SDFinalÞ\nq\nThe pooled effect size was estimated using the\nDerSimonian-Laird method. The estimates of effect sizes\nwere expressed as weighted mean difference (WMD) and\n95% confidence interval (CI). The heterogeneity across stud-\nies was evaluated by using Cochrane ’s Q and I\n2 tests\n(DerSimonian and Kacker 2007). A significance level of\nI2>50% was considered clinically important heterogeneity\n(Ashtary-Larky et al. 2020). To find the possible sources of\nbetween-study heterogeneity, pre-planned subgroup analysis\nwas performed based on participant’s health condition, base-\nline BMI and waist circumference (WC), intervention type,\nand carbohydrate content of the diet. Moreover, since it has\nbeen indicated that several weeks to several months may be\nnecessary for adaptation, for the symptoms of fatigue to sub-\nside, and for adjustments in glycogen homeostasis (Harvey,\nHolcomb, and Kolwicz 2019; Volek et al. 2016), we per-\nformed a subgroup analysis based on trial duration (/C20 8 and\n>8 weeks). Publication bias was evaluated by means of\nBegg’s test, Egger’s regression test, and visual inspection of\nfunnel plots (Egger et al. 1997). All statistical analysis and\ndata synthesis were performed using STATA MP V.14.0.\n(StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA).\nResults\nStudy selection\nThe initial search yielded 1372 articles, 593 of which were\nremoved due to duplication. Another 751 articles were\nexcluded due to the following reasons: unrelated title and\nabstract (n ¼606), animal studies (n ¼91), and review stud-\nies (n ¼54). Consequently, 28 relevant studies remained for\nfull-text review. Among these, 15 articles were excluded\nbecause of a lack of reporting of anthropometric indices.\nFinally, 13 studies were included in the present meta-ana-\nlysis (Greene et al. 2018; Gregory et al. 2017; Hadizadeh\net al. 2020; Jabekk et al. 2010; Kephart et al. 2018;\nLaFountain et al. 2019; Paoli et al. 2021; Paoli et al. 2012;\nRhyu and Cho2014; Vargas-Molina et al.2020; Vargas et al.\n2018; Wilson et al. 2017; Wood et al. 2012). The flow dia-\ngram of the search process is depicted inFigure 1.\nStudy characteristics\nThe characteristics of the RCTs included are outlined in\nTable 1. In total, 244 volunteers were included (case¼ 130,\ncontrol ¼ 134), and the dates of publications were between\n2010 and 2021. Eleven studies (Gregory et al. 2017;\nHadizadeh et al. 2020; Jabekk et al. 2010; Kephart et al.\n2018; LaFountain et al. 2019; Paoli et al. 2021; Rhyu and\nCho 2014; Vargas-Molina et al. 2020; Vargas et al. 2018;\nWilson et al.2017; Wood et al.2012) were designed as par-\nallel RCT and two studies (Greene et al. 2018; Paoli et al.\n2012) were designed as a crossover. The study duration\nranged between three and 12 weeks, and the sample size\nranged from eight to 29 participants. Participant ’s ages\nranged from 16.4 to 58.8 yr, while baseline BMI varied\nbetween 21.2 and 34.5 kg.m\n/C0 2. Six studies enrolled only\nmales (Paoli et al. 2021; Paoli et al. 2012; Rhyu and Cho\n2014; Vargas et al. 2018; Wilson et al. 2017; Wood et al.\n2012), two contained only female participants(Jabekk et al.\n2010; Vargas-Molina et al.2020), four studies included both\nsexes (Greene et al.2018; Gregory et al.2017; Kephart et al.\n2018; LaFountain et al.2019), and one study did not report\nthe sex of participants (Hadizadeh et al.2020). The carbohy-\ndrate content of the KD in these studies ranged from 5-50 g/\nd. These studies were performed in overweight females\n(Jabekk et al. 2010), elite artistic gymnasts (Paoli et al.\n2012), males with metabolic syndrome (Wood et al.2012),\nTaekwondo athletes (Rhyu and Cho 2014), CrossFitters\n(Gregory et al. 2017; Kephart et al.2018), resistance-trained\nmales (Paoli et al. 2021; Vargas et al. 2018; Wilson et al.\n2017) and females (Vargas-Molina et al.2020), intermediate\nto elite competitive lifting athletes (Greene et al. 2018),\nhealthy adults from various military branches (LaFountain\net al. 2019), and untrained adults (Hadizadeh et al.2020).\nResults from quality assessments\nFor random sequence generation, most of the studies had an\nunclear risk of bias (Greene et al.2018; Gregory et al.2017;\nHadizadeh et al. 2020; Jabekk et al. 2010; LaFountain et al.\nCRITICAL REVIEWS IN FOOD SCIENCE AND NUTRITION 3\n\n2019; Rhyu and Cho 2014; Vargas-Molina et al. 2020;\nVargas et al. 2018; Wilson et al. 2017; Wood et al. 2012)\nexcept two studies that had a high risk of bias (Kephart\net al. 2018; Paoli et al.2012), and one study had low risk of\nbias (Paoli et al. 2021). Allocation concealment was\ndescribed clearly in four studies (Gregory et al.2017; Paoli\net al. 2021; Vargas-Molina et al. 2020; Vargas et al. 2018)\nand not clearly in seven studies (Greene et al. 2018;\nHadizadeh et al. 2020; Jabekk et al. 2010; LaFountain et al.\n2019; Rhyu and Cho 2014; Wilson et al. 2017; Wood et al.\n2012). Regarding blinding (participants, personnel, and out-\ncome assessment), all studies had a high risk of bias (Greene\nFigure 1. Flow diagram of the search process.\n4 D.

All of the included\nstudies had a high risk of bias for selective outcome report-\ning (Greene et al.2018; Gregory et al.2017; Hadizadeh et al.\n2020; Jabekk et al. 2010; Kephart et al. 2018; LaFountain\net al. 2019; Paoli et al.2021; Paoli et al.2012; Rhyu and Cho\n2014; Vargas-Molina et al.2020; Vargas et al.2018; Wilson\net al. 2017; Wood et al. 2012). Details of the risk of bias\nassessment are described insupplementary file 1.\nMeta-analysis\nThe results of analysis demonstrated that compared to con-\ntrols (non-KD), KD had a significant effect on BM [(WMD\n¼/C0 3.67 kg; 95% CI:/C0 4.44, /C0 2.90, p < 0.001), (Figure 2)],\nFM [(WMD ¼/C0 2.21 kg; 95% CI:/C0 3.09, /C0 1.34, p < 0.001)],\n(Figure 3 )], FFM [(WMD ¼/C0 1.26 kg; 95% CI: /C0 1.82,\n/C0 0.70, p < 0.001), ( Figure 4 )], BMI [(WMD ¼\n/C0 1.37 kg.m/C0 2; 95% CI:/C0 2.14, /C0 0.59, p ¼0.022), (Figure 5)],\nand BFP [(WMD ¼/C0 2.27%; 95% CI: /C0 3.63, /C0 0.90,\np ¼0.001), (Figure 6)]. Although between-study heterogen-\neity was significant for FM (p ¼0.002, I2 ¼ 62.4%), BMI\n(p ¼0.022, I2 ¼ 68.9%), and BFP (p ¼0.001, I2 ¼ 79.8%), no\nsignificant heterogeneity was detected for BM (p ¼0.261, I2\n¼ 18.1%) and FFM (p ¼0.214, I2 ¼ 22.7%). To find the\nprobable source of heterogeneity, subgroup analysis was\nconducted based on baseline BMI (25 – 29.9 vs. 30 kg.m/C0 2\n/C20 ), trial duration (/C20 8 vs. >8 weeks) and carbohydrate con-\ntent of the KD (/C21 30 vs. <30 g). Subgroup analysis showed\nthat KD intervention had significant effect on BM, BMI,\nFFM, BFP, and FM in all of the subgroups. However, it was\nfound that KD had no significant effect on FFM in over-\nweight participants (Table 2).\nPublication bias\nBased on Egger’s regression test, there was no evidence of\npublication bias for studies examining the effect of KDs on\nBM ( p ¼0.798), BMI ( p ¼0.916), FM ( p ¼0.575), BFP\n(p ¼0.702) and FFM (p ¼0.215). The visually inspected fun-\nnel plot test also confirmed this point ( Supplementary\nmaterial 2).\nFigure 2.

    "discussion": "In this meta-analysis, we evaluated the effects of KDs on\nbody composition in individuals participating in RT.\nAccording to the results derived from this study, a combin-\nation of RT with KD was associated with declines in all\nbody composition parameters including BM, BMI, FM, BFP,\nand FFM. Meanwhile, subgroup analyses based on the dur-\nation of interventions (/C20 8 and > 8 weeks), the carbohydrate\ncontent of the KD (/C21 30 and <30 g/d), and baseline BMI\n(18.5– 24.9, 25 – 29.9, and >30 kg.m\n/C0 2) demonstrated that\nKDs showed statistically similar results across these sub-\ngroups. However, BM, FM, and FFM tended to decrease\nmore following longer interventions (> 8 weeks) and in par-\nticipants with obesity (BMI>30 kg.m\n/C0 2)( Table 2).\nOur results of reduced BM and BMI are similar to the\nfindings of the previous meta-analytic and meta-regressive\nwork on non-exercising populations (Bueno et al. 2013;\nKrieger et al. 2006). One meta-analysis indicated that KD\nproduces slightly greater BM loss as compared to non-KD\n(WMD: 0.91 kg; 95% CI: 0.17– 1.65 kg) over durations of\n12– 24 months (Bueno et al. 2013). Several putative\nexplanations for greater BM loss with KD have previously\nbeen discussed. Importantly, differences in stored glycogen\nand the associated water content could influence BM results,\nalong with other body composition outcomes, when com-\nparing KD and non-KD regimens (Tinsley and Willoughby\n2016). Nonetheless, it has been hypothesized that the benefi-\ncial effect of a KD on BM may be due to the preservation of\nresting energy expenditure (Bueno et al.2013). For instance,\nEbbeling et al. found that a KD had more beneficial effects\non energy expenditure compared to an LFD (Ebbeling et al.\n2012). However, other data have indicated that any increases\nin energy expenditure with KD are small and likely inconse-\nquential (Hall et al. 2016; Hall 2019). Alternatively,\nWestman et al. (Westman et al. 2007) hypothesized that a\nKD reduces insulin concentrations, which would explain the\nsatietogenic effects of this type of diet and potentially lead\nto reduced ad libitum energy intake. Consistent with con-\ntemporary energy balance concepts (Hall et al. 2016), our\nresults illustrated that although KD resulted in more BM\nand FM loss, significant changes occurred only in ad libitum\nstudies (Greene et al.2018; Gregory et al.2017; Jabekk et al.\n2010; Kephart et al.2018; LaFountain et al.2019; Paoli et al.\n2012; Vargas-Molina et al.2020) but not in isocaloric studies\n(Paoli et al. 2021; Rhyu and Cho 2014; Vargas et al. 2018;\nWilson et al. 2017; Wood et al.2012)( Table 1). In ad libi-\ntum settings, physiological ketosis elicited by KDs may result\nin suppressing appetite (Gibson et al.2015) and a resultant\nFigure 3.

It has been previously dem-\nonstrated that both KDs and non-KDs have similar effects\non BM and FM loss when calorie intake decreased the same\namount (Dansinger et al. 2005; Hall et al. 2016).\nConsequently, greater BM loss observed following KDs in\nthe present analysis could likely be due to lower calorie\nintake. Therefore, the metabolic advantage and hyperinsuli-\nnaemic effects of the KD (i.e., the carbohydrate-insulin\nmodel of obesity) that claims diets rich in carbohydrates are\nparticularly fattening due to their propensity to elevate insu-\nlin secretion, which was not evidenced in these included\nstudies. Nonetheless, for those able to adhere to this regi-\nmen, the results of the present analysis indicate that the KD\nis a viable option for enhancing BM and FM loss in ad libi-\ntum settings.\nSome additional possible mechanisms are underlying the\napparent advantageous effects of KDs compared to non-KD\non BM loss. Initial BM loss in participants adhering to a KD\nmay be due to metabolic alterations and body fluid shifts.\nFor example, it appears that initial BM loss can be partially\nattributed to diuresis due to ketone body excretion (keto-\nnuria), which increases renal sodium and hence urinary\nwater loss (McPherson and McEneny 2012). In addition,\nglycogenolysis, which is a prominent feature of the early\nstage of a KD, is associated with concomitant water release\nas /C24 3 g of water are stored for every 1 g of glycogen (Denke\n2001; Fern/C19andez-El/C19ıas et al. 2015; Tinsley and Willoughby\n2016). However, subsequent BM loss is more likely attribut-\nable to FM loss due to restrictive food choices, increased\nsatiety-derived-effects of dietary protein intake (Westerterp-\nPlantenga et al.2009), and an increase in the concentrations\nof b-hydroxybutyrate, (i.e. a ketogenic state), which may\ncontribute to the increased appetite suppression (Veldhorst\net al. 2010). Previous studies have suggested that calorie-for-\ncalorie, protein is more satiating than either carbohydrates\nor fats (Barkeling, R €ossner, and Bj €orvell 1990; Stubbs,\nJohnstone, and Harbron 1996), and it could be suggested\nthat the higher protein intake in the KD played a role in\nlimiting food intake. Therefore, it can be tentatively con-\ncluded that KDs may have a corresponding effect of induc-\ning a negative energy balance in ad libitum settings (Gibson\net al. 2015). A well-designed randomized crossover study\ndemonstrated that high-protein, low-carbohydrate KDs\nreduce hunger and lower food intake significantly more\nthan high-protein, medium-carbohydrate non-KDs\n(Johnstone et al.2008), suggesting that reduced carbohydrate\ncontent between the two high-protein diets resulted in an\nenergy intake decrease of 0.7 MJ/d (294 kcal/d). These find-\nings support the“calories in, calories out\" hypothesis, which\nstates BM loss is not primarily determined by varying pro-\nportions of carbohydrate and fat in the diet per se, but\ninstead by the number of calories ingested, while also pro-\nviding evidence that manipulating the macronutrient content\nof the diet can influence ad libitum energy intake (Howell\nand Kones 2017). Other data have indicated more beneficial\neffects of prescribed KD regimens for fat loss over six\nmonths, as compared to an LFD (Brehm et al.2003).\nIn contrast to reports of longer-term implementation of\nKD in the general population, there is no scientific evidence\non the effects of long-term KD on body composition\nchanges in resistance-trained populations. Indeed, all studies\nincluded in our analysis were short-term (three weeks to\nFigure 6. Forest plot detailing weighted mean difference and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the effect of ketogenic diet (KD) on body fat percentage (BFP).\n10 D. ASHTARY-LARKY ET AL.\n\nthree months). Similar to BM loss, a significant difference in\nFM was observed only in libitum studies. Therefore, it seems\nthat even in short-term interventions, the fat loss benefit of\nKDs is related to calorie intake reduction. These findings\nsuggest that in resistance-trained athletes, when calorie\nintake is equal, KDs do not have more beneficial effects on\nfat loss.\nOne concern of KDs is the potential loss of FFM. It\nseems that in an untrained population, the amount of FFM\nloss is slightly higher following KDs compared to non-KD\n(Brehm et al. 2005; Noakes et al. 2006; Tinsley and\nWilloughby 2016). In our analysis of resistance-trained pop-\nulations, FFM decreased significantly in individuals assigned\nto a KD as compared to non-KD. This catabolic or anti-ana-\nbolic effect of KDs might be attributable to the mechanistic\ntarget of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway inhibition\n(McDaniel et al.2011). Animal and human studies have also\nshown that AMPK is altered following KD interventions. In\nrodents, a KD has increased AMPK activity in skeletal\nmuscle and AMPK phosphorylation in the liver.\nAdditionally, a low-carbohydrate diet supplemented with\nketone esters increased AMPK content in brown adipose\n(Kennedy et al. 2007; McDaniel et al.2011; Srivastava et al.\n2012). In humans, a non-ketogenic, low-carbohydrate diet\n(comprised of 50% fat, 30% carbohydrates, and 20% protein)\nincreased AMPK phosphorylation in skeletal muscle\n(Draznin et al. 2012). Increased AMPK activation inhibits\nmTOR signaling, which is an important factor involved in\nregulating muscle mass gains (Sandri et al.2013).\nPositive effects of carbohydrate intake on net muscle pro-\ntein balance could be another possible mechanism of higher\nFFM loss in KDs. Although it is reported that carbohydrates\nmay not significantly affect MPS (Churchward-Venne, Burd,\nand Phillips 2012), some previous studies have shown that\ncarbohydrate consumption can improve net muscle protein\nbalance by reducing muscle protein breakdown (MPB)\n(Børsheim et al.2004; Roy et al.1997); an effect that may be\nmediated by insulin (Biolo et al.1999; Gelfand and Barrett\n1987; Greenhaff et al. 2008). However, it seems that the\nanti-catabolic of carbohydrate is small compared to protein\nor protein plus carbohydrate intake (Børsheim et al. 2002;\nMiller et al. 2003; Rasmussen et al. 2000; Roy et al. 1997;\nTipton et al.1999; Tipton et al.2001).\nIt is well established that increasing dietary protein intake\nalongside an exercise intervention, especially RT, attenuates\nthe BM loss-induced reduction in muscle mass (Mettler,\nMitchell, and Tipton2010; Verreijen et al.2015; Weiss et al.\n2007). In most studies included in our analysis, participants\nTable 2. Subgroup analysis of ketogenic diet on anthropometric measures.

While it is important to\nnote that FFM and skeletal muscle are distinct but overlap-\nping entities, KDs may result in a significant loss of muscle\nmass as the body recruits amino acids (through de-amina-\ntion or transamination) from skeletal muscle protein to\nmaintain blood glucose via gluconeogenesis. Carbohydrate\nrestriction leads to decreases in blood glucose, and it is pos-\nsible that increased gluconeogenic activity could promote\nMPB to provide an amino acid substrate. Therefore, the pri-\nmary source for a substrate for gluconeogenesis is the amino\nacid pools with some help from glycerol from adipose tissue\ntriglycerides (Fromentin et al. 2013). Using amino acids\nthrough gluconeogenesis can be the reason for the increase\nin amino acids released from muscle tissue, resulting in skel-\netal muscle mass decrements (Pozefsky et al. 1976).\nRegarding the importance of carbohydrate intake for muscle\nmass preservation in individuals participating in an RT pro-\ngram, it has been shown that non-ketogenic hypocaloric\ndiets (1250 calories¼ 55– 60% carbs, 20– 25% protein) com-\nbined with RT have led to FFM preservation (Figueroa et al.\n2013a; Figueroa et al. 2013b), which might be related to a\nlesser degree of amino acid used for gluconeogenesis,\nbecause of higher carbohydrate intake. While high protein\ndiets may generally be beneficial for FFM preservation\n(Haghighat et al. 2020) and participants adhering to KDs\ntypically consumed more protein, this was ultimately insuffi-\ncient for attenuating FFM loss, likely resulting from amino\nacid used for gluconeogenesis. Further long-term interven-\ntion studies with a higher amount of daily protein intake\nand optimally designed RT programs may be needed to\nallow for additional evaluation of changes in FFM following\nKDs compared to non-KDs. Additionally, more direct esti-\nmates of skeletal muscle size should be employed alongside\nwhole-body FFM estimation.\nOur results should be interpreted in the context of the\nfollowing limitations. First, since all RCTs lasted less than\nthree months, our analysis is unable to show the long-term\ndifferences in KDs and non-KDs on body composition in\nresistance-trained athletes. Moreover, included studies uti-\nlized varying body composition assessment methods, and\nsome provide different estimates of nonfat tissue (i.e. lean\nbody mass and FFM terms), which are often used inter-\nchangeably despite theoretical differences (Prado,\nHeymsfield, and Nutrition 2014). There are additional limi-\ntations of the studies included in the present analysis,\nincluding difficulty in establishing isocaloric diets in free-liv-\ning conditions and lack of RT supervision or standardization\nin several investigations. Furthermore, significant heterogen-\neity was encountered, perhaps due to various populations\nenrolled. The included studies were performed in various\ntypes of participants, such as elite and amateur athletes in\ndifferent sports and untrained individuals. This is a notable\nlimitation and should be considered as it may significantly\nundermine the validity of results. Finally, it should be men-\ntioned that a higher BM loss could result in great FFM dec-\nrements (Saris 2001), which could potentially explain the\nhigher FFM loss after KDs in our analysis.\nIn",
    "conclusion": ", KDs lead to a loss of BM, BMI, FM, FFM,\nand BFP in RT cohorts. Additional longer-term and high-\nquality RCTs are needed to further evaluate and confirm\nthese findings. As higher protein intake can exert favorable\neffects on FFM (Haghighat et al. 2020), further research\nemploying KDs with higher protein intakes than observed in\nthe present analysis may help determine whether FFM can\nbe adequately preserved or increased in resistance-trained\nindividuals. Moreover, future investigations should focus on\noptimizing external RT variables, such as load and rest peri-\nods, to create a greater hypertrophic stimulus and, therefore,\npotentially reduce the loss of FFM during KDs in resistance-\ntrained individuals. Future research should also employ\nmore direct estimates of skeletal muscle size to further clar-\nify the effects of KDs on this important body component.\nDisclosure statement\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis work received no specific external funding.\nORCID\nAmir Abbasnezhad http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9436-7334\nReferences\nAntonio, J., A.
