    "abstract": "Background: Range of motion (ROM) during \nresistance training is of growing interest and is \npotentially used to elicit differing adaptations (e.g. \nmuscle hypertrophy and muscular strength and \npower). To date, attempts at synthesising the data \non ROM during resistance training have primarily \nfocused on muscle hypertrophy in the lower body.\nObjective: Our aim was to meta-analyse and \nsystematically review the effects of ROM on a variety \nof outcomes including hypertrophy, strength, sport, \npower and body-fat type outcomes. Following pre-\nregistration and consistent with PRISMA guidelines, \na systematic review of PubMed and SportsDISCUS \nwas performed. Data was extracted and a Bayesian \nmulti-level meta-analysis was performed. A range \nof exploratory sub-group and moderator analyses \nwere performed.",
    "results": "The main model revealed \na trivial SMD (0.12; 95% CI: –0.02, 0.26) in favour of \nfull ROM compared to partial ROM. When grouped \nby outcome, standardized mean differences (SMDs) \nall favoured full ROM, but SMDs were trivial to small \n(all between 0.05 to 0.2). Sub-group analyses \nsuggested there may be a muscle hypertrophy \nbenefit to partial ROM training at long muscle lengths \ncompared to using a full ROM (–0.28; 95% CI: –0.81, \n0.16). Analysis also suggested the existence of a \nspecificity aspect to ROM, such that training in the \nROM being tested as an outcome resulted in greater \nstrength adaptations. No clear differences were \nfound between upper- and lower-body adaptations \nwhen ROM was manipulated.",
    "conclusions": "Overall, \nour results suggest that using a full or long ROM \nmay enhance results for most outcomes (strength, \nspeed, power, muscle size, and body composition). \nDifferences in adaptations are trivial to small. As \nsuch, partial ROM resistance training might present \nan efficacious alternative for variation and personal \npreference, or where injury prevents full-ROM \nresistance training.\nKeywords: muscle hypertrophy, muscle strength, \npower, sport, bodyfat, strength training, muscle \nlength, regional muscle hypertrophy",
    "introduction": "Resistance training (RT) is commonly used to induce \nmuscle hypertrophy, increase strength and improve \nsport performance. Indeed, resistance training \nis employed across a variety of sports, notably \nsports in which muscularity is directly rewarded \n(e.g. bodybuilding) or where resistance training is \nthe sport itself (e.g., powerlifting and strongman) \nto ones in which resistance training can improve \nperformance on the field(e.g. enhance vertical jump, \nsprint time, etc.) [1,2]. \nIn recent years, the range of motion (ROM) employed \nduring RT has become a controversial topic. \nWhilst some findings suggest a superiority of full \nROM (fROM) in some contexts (e.g. when muscle \nhypertrophy is desired in several muscle groups), \nothers argue for the use of partial ROM (pROM) in \nother contexts (e.g. when muscle hypertrophy is \nonly desired in specific muscle groups) [3,4]. Whilst, \nboth pROM and fROM RT produce improvements in \nmuscle size, it has been reported that fROM RT is \nCopyright: © 2021 by the authors. Licensee IUSCA, London, UK.

Evidence in the upper body \nis more equivocal [5,6] and research has not \nbeen consolidated in review. Similarly, in regard \nto performance outcomes such as strength, both \npROM and fROM RT have been shown to stimulate \nimprovements [7–9]. Specifically, in resistance-\ntrained men, both pROM and fROM lower body \nRT have been shown to elicit improvements in \nperformance outcomes such as counter-movement \njump height, 20 m sprint time and Wingate Test peak \nand mean power [10]. \nWhilst both pROM and fROM RT have been shown to \nproduce improvements in a variety of muscle size and \nperformance outcomes it is unclear which strategy, \nif any, results in greater adaptations. Indeed, there \nare inherent differences between pROM and fROM \nRT that could plausibly lead to meaningfully different \nadaptations, both in magnitude and in transferability \nto performance outcomes. For example, it has \nbeen shown that during isometric training, the \nlength at which a muscle is trained impacts the \nresulting adaptations [11]. Evidence suggests that \nisometrically training a muscle at longer lengths \nmay produce greater increases in muscle volume \nthan training it at short lengths [11]. In addition, \nimprovements in isometric peak force appear to be \njoint angle-specific, such that training a muscle at \nshorter lengths likely results in greater improvements \nin isometric peak force at shorter muscle lengths and \nvice versa [11]. It is unclear whether these findings \napply to dynamic resistance training.\nIn addition, it has been suggested that pROM RT may \npromote greater muscle deoxygenation and greater \nblood lactate accumulation compared to fROM \nRT [6]. Mechanistically, these differences in acute \nresponses to ROM may lead to divergent training \nadaptations [12,13]. In addition, it is plausible that \npROM RT may lead to greater improvements in \nperformance outcomes such as vertical jumps and \nsprint times compared to fROM RT [14]. Indeed, \nthrough training the joint angles in a task-specific \nmanner, pROM may be superior to fROM in inducing \nthese adaptations. There is likely no “one-size-\nfits-all” approach to ROM in training for different \nsports/movement patterns. In rugby, for example, \nscrumming may benefit moreso from pROM training, \nwhereas tasks like baseball pitching, which involve \ngreater ranges of motion, may benefit from fROM \ntraining. Finally, pROM training might be beneficial \nwhen an athlete/trainee has a musculoskeletal \ninjury, for example, where loading a muscle through \na fROM may accentuate pain [15]. To summarize – \nit is unclear if and when using different ranges of \nmotion may lead to different results in morphological \nand/or musculoskeletal function outcomes.\nA previous systematic review by Schoenfeld & \nGrgic (2020) examined the effect of ROM during \nRT on muscle hypertrophy [16]. Although data \nwere limited at the time of publication, this review \nsuggested that greater ROM was superior for \nhypertrophy in the lower body musculature, but \nthe effects of ROM were less clear in the muscles \nof the upper body. More recently, a meta-analysis \nand systematic review on the effects of ROM on \ntraining adaptations was published by Pallares \net al. (2021) [17]. The findings suggested that full \nROM was superior for muscle strength, functional \nperformance and lower-limb muscle hypertrophy. \nThe authors abstained from analysing data on \nupper-limb muscle hypertrophy due to scarcity of \nevidence. Despite the currently available literature \non the effect of ROM on upper-limb hypertrophy \nand/or strength being limited, meta-analytically \nassessing the totality of the available literature may \nallow us to better understand the effect of pROM \nversus fROM on a multitude of musculoskeletal and \nmorphological outcomes. Additionally, previous \nresearch has not included further sub-analyses on \ndifferent moderators within the topic of full versus \npartial ROM (e.g. muscle length at which pROM is \nperformed). Thus, the current article aims to both \nreview and meta-analyse the available data on ROM \nand musculoskeletal function and morphology.",
    "methods": "This systematic review and meta-analysis were \nconducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting \nItems for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses \n(PRISMA) guidelines [18]. This study was pre-\nregistered on the Open Science Framework \n(OSF; https://osf.io/j96e7) using the International \nProspective Register of Systematic Reviews \n(PROSPERO) template, though some of the methods \nadopted have changed since the original pre-\nregistration.\nInclusion Criteria\nBoth full-text, peer-reviewed studies and doctoral/\nmaster’s theses were included when they were \navailable in English.

P., Schoenfeld, B. J., \n& Steele, J.\nsize, muscle strength, sports, power or bodyfat). No \nrestrictions were placed on publication date.\nSearch Strategy\nPubMed/Medline and SportsDISCUS databases \nwere searched for studies up to August 2022. The \nfollowing search string was used: ““resistance \ntraining” AND “range of motion” AND (“muscle \nthickness” OR “cross sectional area” OR “muscle \nvolume” OR “muscle mass” OR “hypertrophy” OR \n“muscle strength”). Both the abstracts/titles and the \nfull-texts were examined for inclusion by MW and \nPAK. Screening was performed using abstrackr \n(http://abstrackr.cebm.brown.edu/). Studies \ndeemed irrelevant were excluded. Once all studies \nreturned through the search had been screened \nfor inclusion, the reference lists of included studies \nwere screened for inclusion. Publications that cited \nincluded studies were also screened for inclusion.\nQuality Assessment\nThe quality of studies that met inclusion criteria was \nassessed using the TESTEX scale [19]. The TESTEX \nscale is an alternative to the PEDro scale designed \nspecifically for exercise science training studies [19]. \nIt has been shown to be reliable and is composed \nof 12 items relating to both study quality and study \nreporting. Finally, a GRADE table of evidence (Table \n2) was produced to clearly communicate findings \nusing GradePro (https://www.gradepro.org/) . This \nwas performed by MW.\nData Extraction\nThe following data was extracted/coded from \nstudies that met inclusion criteria by MW: study \ndesign, weighted mean age, weighted mean height, \nintervention duration, total study duration, sex \nof participants, training status, population, ROM \nused by the pROM group/condition, ROM used \nby the fROM group/condition, proportion of sets \nbeing performed with a full/PROM, muscle length \ntrained, training frequency, mean number of weekly \nsets performed, mean repetition duration, mean \nnumber of repetitions performed per set, number of \nexercises, mean proximity to momentary muscular \nfailure, mean load, modality of training, presence of \nauxiliary interventions and whether other exercises \nwere performed besides the exercise(s) on which \nROM was manipulated. The pre-registration noted \ntwo groupings of outcomes (musculoskeletal \nfunction and morphology) though noted that after the \nsystematic search and review additional outcomes \nwould be extracted depending on what studies \nhad measured. After data extraction we opted \nto group outcomes into the following categories: \nbody composition outcomes, strength outcomes, \npower outcomes, and sport outcomes. Finally, if \nan outcome measure favoured, that is to say may \nhave been biased towards, either full or pROM \ngroup/condition (e.g. partial squat 1-repetition-\nmaximum (1RM) favouring a partial squat group), \nthis was also noted. Where data was not available in \nthe full-text, the authors were contacted to request \nmissing data. When their contact information was \nunavailable, the institution at which the work was \nperformed was contacted to obtain it. If no response \nwas received to the initial request, a second email \nwas sent a few weeks later. If no response was \nobtained to the second attempt, data was obtained \nvia WebPlotDigitizer (v4.4, Ankit Rohatgi) where \npossible. The data were transcribed/imported into a \n.csv file.\nMeta-Analysis\n \nAll analysis code utilized is presented in the \nsupplementary materials (https://osf.io/fmvrw/). \nGiven the aim of this research, we opted to take \nan estimation-based approach [20], conducted \nwithin a Bayesian framework [21]. For all analyses, \neffect estimates and their precision, along with \nconclusions based upon them, were interpreted \ncontinuously and probabilistically, considering data \nquality, plausibility of effect, and previous literature, \nall within the context of each outcome [22]. The main \nexploratory meta-analysis was performed using the \n‘brms’ package [23] with posterior draws taken \nusing ‘tidybayes’ [24] and ‘emmeans’ in R (v 4.0.2; R \nCore Team, https://www.r-project.org/) [25]. All data \nvisualizations were made using ‘ggplot2’ [26], and \n‘patchwork’ [27].\nAs the included studies often had multiple groups/\nconditions and reported effects within these \nfor multiple sessions/exercises/sets - we opted \nto calculate effect sizes as a nested structure. \nTherefore, multilevel mixed-effects meta-analyses \nwere performed with both inter-study and intra-\nstudy groups included as random effects in the \nmodel. Effects were weighted by inverse sampling \nvariance to account for the within- and between-\nstudy variance. A main model included all effects \nfor all outcomes in the included studies. We also \nconducted several exploratory meta-regression and \nsub-group analyses of moderators (i.e., predictors \nof effects) to explore study protocols and participant \ncharacteristics.

However, \nwe also present supplementary models using \nthe log response ratio of means (RR) which was \nexponentiated and presented as the percentage \ndifference in changes between fROM and pROM. \nThese are available in the supplementary files (see \nhttps://osf.io/fmvrw/ folder “Figures and Output” \n-> “lnRR models”). All effect sizes were calculated \nappropriately given the study designs involved for \npre-post control comparisons [28,29]. \nFor all models, we used uninformed priors; recent \nmeta-analyses might have been used to inform \npriors, however this would constitute a form of ‘double \ncounting’ given the studies that were included in \nthem have also been included in the likelihoods for \nthe present models. Models were estimated using \n231 Monte Carlo Markov Chains with 2000 warmup \nand 6000 sampling iterations. Trace plots were \nused to examine chain convergence and posterior \npredictive checks to examine model validity. Draws \nwere taken from the posterior distributions to \nconstruct probability density functions for plotting. \nWe then calculated the mean and the 95%, 80%, and \n50% quantile intervals (‘credible’ or ‘compatibility’ \nintervals) from the posterior probability density \nfunctions for each group effect estimate. These \ngave us the most probable value of the parameter \nfor a given level of probability.\n1 C -1 where C was the number of cores available on the \ncomputer used to run the analysis (build available here: https://\nuk.pcpartpicker.com/list/C6VXRT). \nSEARCH RESULTS\nThe search string identified 576 publications/\ntheses for potential inclusion, while 19 others were \nidentified through websites and citation searching. \nOnce duplicates were removed, 344 studies \nremained. The titles and abstracts were screened, \nand, where deemed appropriate, full-text versions \nwere sought to determine eligibility. Ultimately, 27 \nstudies were included in review. One study was \neventually excluded during the data extraction due \nto excessive missing data. Two further theses were \nexcluded because they contained the same data \nas another publication that was already included. \nFigure 1 details this process.

Some studies used mechanical stops built-\nin to the equipment being used – such as isokinetic \ndynamometers/electric goniometers/tensiometers \n[30]. In other studies, participants’ ROM was \ncontrolled using physical stops like the metallic bars \nused to delineate partial ROM by Pedrosa et al. \n(2021) & Pinto et al. (2012) [5,48]. Finally, in some \nstudies, the ROM used was less clearly defined \nand participants were supervised by personnel to \nensure the ROM being used was correct – though \nthe accuracy of this method may not be ideal [34].\nIt is also interesting to note that few studies \nindividualised the ROM being used to the individual’s \nfROM [34]. In other words, for most studies, a \ncertain amount of ROM was deemed a “full” ROM, \nregardless of what each individual participant’s \nfROM truly was. The specifics of ROMs being used \ncan be found in Table 1.\nMuscle length of partial range of motion training\nIt is worth noting that most studies (19/23 studies) \nexamined pROM when performed – at least for some \nof the volume performed – at short muscle lengths. \nIn contrast, relatively few studies have examined \npROM at either moderate muscle lengths (1/23) \n(defined as the middle of fROM) or long muscle \nlengths (6/23).\nThe specific findings of all studies can be seen in \nTable 1 and a GRADE table of evidence can be \nseen in Table 2.\nMeta-Analysis Results\nMain Model – all outcomes\nThe main model – including all effects on all outcomes \nacross 23 studies – revealed a trivial standardized \nmean difference (SMD) (0.12; 95% CI: –0.02, 0.26) \nin favour of fROM compared to pROM (Figure 2). All \neffect sizes (ticks), posterior probability distributions \nand the overall estimate are displayed below in \nFigure 2.\nSub-Group Analyses\nGrouped by outcome type\nOutcomes were grouped by type (such as “power” \nand “muscle size” outcomes) and sub-group \nanalyses were performed. For “strength” type \noutcomes (e.g. 1RM test), analysis revealed a trivial \nSMD (0.14; 95% CI: -0.01, 0.29) in favour of fROM. \nFor “sport” type outcomes (e.g. sprint time), analysis \nsuggested a trivial SMD (0.02; 95% CI: –0.22, 0.26) \nin favour of fROM. For “power” type outcomes (e.g. \nrate of force development), analysis showed a trivial \nSMD (0.19; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.37) in favour of fROM. \nFor “muscle size” type outcomes (e.g. muscle cross-\nsectional area), analysis revealed a trivial SMD (0.04; \n95% CI: –0.17, 0.25) in favour of fROM. Finally, for \n“Body Fat” type outcomes (e.g. bodyfat %), analysis \nsuggested a trivial SMD (0.12; 95% CI: –0.36, 0.6) in \nfavour of fROM. Figure 3 displays individual effect \nsizes as ticks, posterior probability distributions and \noverall estimates for each outcome.\nStudy design\nStudies were categorized as either being within-\nsubject designs (e.g. the same subjects used \ndifferent ranges of motion for different limbs) or \nbetween-subject designs (e.g. subjects were \nassigned to performing either a fROM intervention or \na pROM intervention). For within-participant designs, \nanalysis revealed a small SMD (0.22; 95% CI: –0.16, \n0.6) favouring fROM for all outcomes. For between-\nparticipant designs, analysis revealed a trivial SMD \n(0.1; 95% CI: –0.06, 0.25) favouring fROM.

The most commonly met criteria \nfor study quality included groups being similar at \nbaseline, titration/progression of relative training \nintensity across the program and at least some of \nthe statistical tests’ results being reported. The \nleast commonly met criteria included complete \nreporting of the outcome data (including measures \nof variance) using point estimates and measuring \nand/or reporting adherence during the intervention.\nPotential Bias in the review process\nOne of this review’s unique features is the inclusion \nof Master’s/Doctoral Theses. Indeed, by including \ntheses, more data can be analysed and greater \nconfidence can be had in the findings of this review. \nFurther, this review screened abstracts from three \nseparate databases, in addition to reference/citation \nchecking. As such, it is hoped that, if not the entirety of \nthe literature on ROM, the vast majority of the relevant \nliterature was included. Inclusion criteria were \npurposely kept simple and lenient for that reason. \nThe use of the TESTEX scale also provides a gauge \nof study quality. With that being said, this review also \nsuffers from a few meaningful limitations. Firstly, the \ninclusion of theses may result in the inclusion of data \nthat has not undergone a peer review process as \nrigorous as published data. Secondly, though an \neffort has been made throughout the manuscript to \nindicate that sub-group or regression analyses are \ndeemed exploratory, it is worth reiterating that many \nof these analyses lack the data and statistical power \nto make any confident inferences. Finally, while an \neffort was made to obtain as much of the data as \npossible, we were unable to obtain some of the data. \nThus, it is possible that the results of this review \ncould have been meaningfully different had all the \ndata been available.",
    "discussion": "This article aimed to review and meta-analyse the \neffects of ROM during RT on a range of outcomes. \nThe major finding from this systematic review and \nmeta-analysis was that ROM during RT appears \nto have at most a modest impact on outcomes of \ninterest. When all outcomes were pooled, the impact \nof ROM was trivial to small (for example, the RR \nranged showed a difference between conditions of \n2.8% [95% CI: -1.69% to 7.42%] change favouring \nfROM; https://osf.io/ahjnf).\nOur results suggest that different ROMs may be \nappropriate for different goals. For example, when \ntraining for a specific performance outcome (e.g. \na partial squat 1RM in a powerlifting competition), \nit appears that training in a similar ROM may \nmaximise improvements by a trivial to small margin. \nThese results strongly suggest that the principle \nof specificity applies to ROM – though the benefit \nmay be more modest than commonly assumed. \nWhen looking at outcomes grouped by category \n(e.g. muscle size, strength.), differences in results \nbetween pROM and fROM were largely trivial. That \nsaid, it is noteworthy that all effect sizes, although \nsmall in magnitude, directionally favoured fROM. \nAs such, utilising a fROM during resistance training \nmay prove to be an effective “default” strategy. It \nis important to note that the use of ROM is not \nnecessarily a binary decision as some training can \nbe fROM while other training may be pROM.\nOur analyses also supported the hypothesis that \nperforming pROM RT at long muscle lengths results \nin greater muscle hypertrophy than both pROM RT \nat short muscle lengths and fROM RT. This suggests \nthat if muscle hypertrophy is the goal, trainees may \nwish to use pROM RT at long muscle lengths in their \ntraining. There is substantial supporting evidence \nfor the concept of resistance training at long muscle \nlengths for optimising hypertrophy. Oranchuk et \nal. (2019)’s systematic review on the effects of \nisometric training on adaptations suggested that \nacross three studies that included isometric training \nat different muscle lengths, longer muscle length \ntraining resulted in greater increases in muscle size \nin all three [11].\nThe evidence directly comparing the effects of \npROM RT at different muscle lengths on muscle size \nis also reasonably consistent. Six studies exist in this \narea. As reviewed above, Pedrosa et al. (2021) [48] \nshowed greater quadriceps growth following pROM \nRT at longer compared to shorter muscle lengths. A \nsimilar previous study by McMahon et al. (2014) [54] \nhad seen similar results in the vastus lateralis. Further, \nMaeo et al. (2020) also saw greater hypertrophy in \nthe biarticular segments of the hamstrings following \nRT at longer muscle lengths compared to RT at \nshorter muscle lengths [49]. Similar results were \nfound by both Sato et al. (2021) in the elbow flexors \n[50]. A further study by Maeo et al. (2022) featured \na within-subject design comparing “neutral-arm” \n\nInternational Journal of Strength and Conditioning. 2023\nPartial Vs Full Range of Motion Resistance Training: A Systematic \nReview and Meta-Analysis\n18Copyright: © 2021 by the authors.

In contrast with this \nstudy, a study by Stasinaki et al. (2018) found no \nsignificant differences in triceps brachii long head \nhypertrophy following pROM RT at longer vs shorter \nmuscle lengths [52]. Further, long muscle lengths \ngenerally appear to result in a greater degree of \npassive tension as passive tissues begin to reach \nmaximal length and provide resistance to further \nincreases in muscle length [53]. Tension itself has \nbeen suggested to activate the mTORC1 pathway \nwhich is associated with muscle hypertrophy [54]. A \ngreater degree of passive tension during pROM RT \nat long muscle lengths may thus contribute to greater \nmTORC1 pathway activation and thus greater \nmuscle hypertrophy than during pROM RT at short \nmuscle lengths. Further, emerging evidence also \nsuggests stretch-mediated hypertrophy may play a \nsubstantial role in humans. In a recent investigation \nby Warneke et al. (2022) [55], the gastrocnemius \nmuscle showed substantial hypertrophy when \nstretched at the maximally dorsiflexed position for \nan hour per day for six weeks.\nWhile these bodies of literature are perhaps not \nconvincing enough on their own, when considered \nin combination, the evidence converges to suggest \nthat training at longer muscle lengths is very likely of \nbenefit when seeking to maximise muscle growth. It \nis possible that fROM RT is only superior to pROM \nRT if and when it includes longer muscle lengths. \nFurther, it is a possibility that pROM RT at long \nmuscle lengths – and even isometric contractions at \nlong muscle lengths – may be equal to or superior to \nfROM RT for inducing muscle hypertrophy, however, \nthis area requires more research.\nGiven how effective pROM at long muscle lengths \nappears to be, previous reviews on muscle \nhypertrophy and ROM may have over-estimated the \nbeneficial impact of fROM on muscle hypertrophy. \nSpecifically, in their meta-analysis, Pallarés et al. \n(2021) found a large effect size (0.88) in favour of \nfROM for muscle hypertrophy [17]. Notably, only \nlower-limb hypertrophy was analysed; as such, only \n4 studies were included. In contrast, when looking \nonly at muscle hypertrophy outcomes, our analysis \nrevealed a trivial SMD of 0.05 (Figure 3; RR: -0.88% \n[95% CI: -10.87%, 10.31%]; see https://osf.io/uv5d7). \nThis difference is likely explained by the inclusion \nof more data; studies including upper-body muscle \ngroups as well as studies that have been published \nafter the analysis by Pallarés et al. (2021) [17].\nIn their systematic review, Schoenfeld & Grgic \n(2020) concluded that evidence suggested that \nfROM RT was superior to pROM RT for lower-limb \nhypertrophy but that the effects were less clear in \nthe upper body [16]. The difference between this \narticle’s results and theirs likely stems from the \ninclusion of trials that have been published since the \npublication of Schoenfeld & Grgic’s (2020) review \narticle [16]. They also surmised that the response to \nROM during RT may be muscle-specific. Our sub-\ngroup analysis (Figure 7.) comparing upper- vs- \nlower body outcomes does not support this idea, \nthough further research would be helpful in testing \nthis hypothesis.\nSeveral studies have found greater distal \nhypertrophy (defined as >50% of the muscle length \nfrom the origin) following fROM RT or pROM RT at \nlong muscle lengths compared to pROM RT at short \nmuscle lengths, but similar proximal hypertrophy \n[8,37,48]. That said, sub-group analysis of regional \nhypertrophy (Figure 5.) only showed a small SMD \n(0.32; 95% CI: –1.14, 1.86) in favour of fROM RT \nfor distal hypertrophy and a trivial SMD (0.16; 95% \nCI: –1.43, 1.73) in favour of fROM RT for proximal \nhypertrophy (see https://osf.io/wdjxg for RRs). If \na difference in regional hypertrophy does exist \nbetween pROM and fROM RT or shorter and longer \nmuscle length training, further data are required to \ngive this",
    "conclusion": "further credibility.\nIt is important to note that for some outcomes (such \nas bodyfat) and some sub-group or moderator \nanalyses (such as proximal vs distal hypertrophy), \nthe analyses are based on very few data and are \nrelatively underpowered. As such, caution is advised \nwhen drawing conclusions.\nThe reader can adopt two viewpoints. The first \nbest befits researchers and is more conceptual. \nIt consists in regarding ROM as a relatively \ninconsequential variable, many of these analyses as \nbeing underpowered and viewing range of motion \nresearch as an area in its infancy, lacking the data \nrequired to come to any sort of consensus on the \ntopic. \nThe second viewpoint aims to minimize “false \nnegative” errors and best befits practitioners.

The practitioner \nmay also recognize the value in small effects whose \nexistence is relatively uncertain, as even these small \npotential gains may be meaningful to many coaches \nand athletes, competitive and recreational alike [56].\nCONCLUSION\nfROM outperformed pROM for all outcome types, \nbut effect sizes ranged from trivial to small SMDs at \nbest (overall RR between conditions of 2.8% [95% \nCI: -1.69% to 7.42%] change favouring fROM). \nIt appears that there may be small differences in \noutcomes depending on exactly how ROM was \nmanipulated (e.g., short vs long muscle lengths for \nregional hypertrophy), so coaches/athletes may wish \nto adopt the ROM strategy most appropriate to their \ngoals. The principle of specificity likely also applies \nto ROM, such that training should usually replicate \nthe ROM of the outcome of interest. While using a \nfROM approach may be a good “default” approach, \noverall, these results suggest that a variety of ROMs \ncan be used to good effect, whether that be due to \ninjury management or personal preference.\nThe researchers would be interested in seeing future \nstudies compare the adaptations following pROM \ntraining at different muscle lengths compared to \na fROM. For example, a study examining muscle \nthickness adaptations following resistance training \nin two pROM conditions at different muscle lengths \nand one fROM condition. For ease of future analysis \nand/or replication, future research should also \nensure data is either openly available or, at least, \neasier to extract. Failing this, efforts should be made \nto provide data upon request.\nABBREVIATIONS\nROM: range of motion\npROM: partial range of motion\nfROM: full range of motion\nDECLARATIONS\nEthics approval and consent to participate\nNot applicable\nConsent for publication\nNot applicable.\nAvailability of data and material\nAnalysis scripts, datasheet, digitized pictures, \nfigures for all analyses, text outputs for all analyses, \nGRADE table of evidence, systematic search results \nand some screening details and TESTEX results are \nall available in the supplementary materials. \nFUNDING\nFunding for the lead investigator’s PhD project was \nprovided by Renaissance Periodization.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nMany thanks to James Wright and Eric Helms \nfor providing useful feedback on the finished \nmanuscript. \nCOMPETING INTERESTS\nThe authors declare no competing interests with the \ncontents of this manuscript.\nREFERENCES\n1.
