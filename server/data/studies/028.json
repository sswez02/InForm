    "results": "of this meta-analysis, there we re no differences between moderate and high \ntraining volume responses for the quadriceps (p = 0.19) and th e biceps brachii (p = 0.59). However, it appears that a \nhigh training volume is better to induce muscle mass gains in the triceps brachii (p = 0.01). According to the results of \nthis review, a range of 12-20 weekly sets per muscle group may be an optimum standard recommendation for increasing \nmuscle hypertrophy in young, trained men. \nKey words: strength, muscle mass, resistance training, muscle gains, training variables.",
    "introduction": "Mechanical tension is one of the main \nmechanisms inducing muscle hypertrophy by \nleading to signal transduction and increasing \nmuscle protein synthesis (MPS) (Olsen et al., 2019; \nWackerhage et al., 2018). In order to generate an \noptimal stimulus, several variables can be \nmanipulated, being traini ng volume, time under \ntension (TUT), frequency, load (generally \nexpressed as percentages of the 1-repetition \nmaximum) or proximity to muscle failure which is \nthe most widely used (Bird et al., 2005). Proximity \nto failure is essential to achieve an optimal \nstimulus for muscle hype rtrophy, regardless of \nthe repetition range used, due to an increase in \nthe recruitment of motor units (MUs) and their \nfatigue (Dankel et al., 2017; Morton et al., 2019). \nThis proximity to failure could be managed by \nincreasing the number of repetitions or by \nincreasing the TUT within the same number of \nrepetitions (Wilk et al., 2020). However, as long as \nthe level of effort is high, training volume seems \nto be the most important variable (Schoenfeld et \nal., 2017). Therefore, when muscle hypertrophy is \nthe main goal, training volume can be quantified \nas the number of sets per muscle group which are \nclose to failure (Baz-Valle et al., 2018), namely, \n“hard sets”. \n \n\n\n200 A systematic review of the effects of different resistance training volumes on muscle hypertrophy \nJournal of Human Kinetics - volume 81/2022 http://www.johk.pl \n \nFrom an acute physiological standpoint, \nthere is evidence suggesting a dose-response \nrelationship between training volume and \nphosphorylation of proteins related to MPS \n(Gerasimos Terzis et al., 2010), or directly an \nincrease in MPS (Burd et al., 2010). Interestingly, a \nrecent study found greater responses in ribosomal \nbiogenesis after an intervention of moderate \ntraining volume vs. low training volume \n(Hammarström et al., 2020). Ribosomal \nbiogenesis, understood as ribosomal capacity, has \nbeen linked to long-term muscle mass gains along \nwith ribosomal efficiency, since they are \nimportant physiological adaptations (Figueiredo, \n2019). Moreover, this dose-response relationship \nhas also been verified in longitudinal studies as a \nchronic response (Schoenfeld et al., 2019a), with a \nsystematic review and meta-analysis (Schoenfeld \net al., 2017) confirming these findings, with \nfavorable results when performing over nine \nweekly sets per muscle group. \n Over the last few years, training volume \nfor muscle hypertrophy has received a lot of \nattention (Aube et al., 2020; Brigatto et al., 2019; \nHeaselgrave et al., 2019). Some studies support \nthe dose-response hypothesis (Brigatto et al., \n2019), while others propose an inverted “U” \nrelationship between training volume and muscle \nmass gains (Heaselgrave et al., 2019). It is against \nthis apparently contradictory background that \nthis review intends to compare exclusively the \nresponse to moderate vs. high training volumes, \nin studies as homogeneous as possible, which \ninclude young trained men, and in which direct \nmuscular hypertrophy measurements were taken. \nWe hypothesized that the dose-response \nrelationship would be minimal when comparing \nmoderate and high training volumes.",
    "methods": "Study design \n A literature search of 3 databases was \nconducted in January, 2021. The following \ndatabases were searched: PubMed, Scopus and \nCochrane Library. Databases were searched from \ninception up to January 2021, with no language \nlimitation. Citations from scientific conferences \nwere excluded. \n Search strategy \n The literature search was conducted in \naccordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for \n \n \nSystematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) \nguidelines. In each databa se, the title,",
    "abstract": ", \nand keywords search fields were searched. The \nfollowing keywords, combined with Boolean \noperators (AND/OR) were used: “resistance \ntraining” AND Muscles AND hypertrophy OR \n“muscle thickness” AND volume. “Muscles” and \n“hypertrophy” were MeSH terms. No additional \nfilters or search limitations were used. After \nconducting the initial search, the reference lists of \narticles retrieved were then screened for any \nadditional articles which had relevance to the \ntopic. \n Eligibility criteria \n Studies were eligible for further analysis if \nthe following inclusion criteria were met: a) \nstudies were randomized controlled trials \ncomparing different groups with a different \nnumber of sets explicitly reported, with the same \nload assignment (%1-re petition maximum or \nXRM) and without the use of external implements \n(i.e., pressure cuffs, hypo xic chamber, etc.), b) \ninterventions lasted at least six weeks, c) \nparticipants had a minimum of one year of \nresistance training experience, d) participants’ age \nranged from 18 to 35 years, e) studies reported \ndirect measurements of muscle thickness and/or \nthe cross-sectional area, f) studies were published \nin peer-review journals. \n Two independent observers reviewed the \nstudies and then individually decided whether \ninclusion was appropriate. In the event of \ndisagreement, a third observer was consulted. A \nflow chart of the search strategy and study \nselection is shown in Figure 1. \nStudy quality \n Oxford’s level of evidence (OCEBM \nLevels of Evidence Working Group et al., 2011) \nand the Physiotherapy Evidence Database \n(PEDro) scale (de Morton, 2009) were used by two \nindependent observers to assess the \nmethodological quality of the studies included in \nthe systematic review. Oxford’s level of evidence \nranges from 1a to 5, with 1a being systematic \nreviews of high-quality randomized controlled \ntrials and 5 being expert opinions. The PEDro \nscale consists of 11 different items related to \nscientific rigor. Given that the assessors are rarely \nblinded, and that it is hard to blind participants \nand investigators in supervised exercise \ninterventions, items 5–7, which are specific to \n \n\nby Eneko Baz-Valle et al. 201 \n© Editorial Committee of Journal of Human Kinetics \n \nblinding, were removed from the scale (Baz-Valle \net al., 2018). With the re moval of these items, the \nmaximum result on the modified PEDro 8-point \nscale was 7 (the first item was not included in the \ntotal score) and the lowest, 0. Zero points were \nawarded to a study that failed to satisfy any of the \nincluded items, and 7 pointed to a study that \nsatisfied all the included items. \nIncluded studies for qualitative and quantitative \nsynthesis \n In the present systematic review, seven \nstudies met the inclusion criteria, in which low \nvolume groups were included (<12 sets per week) \ndescriptively in the qualitative synthesis, along \nwith moderate (12-20 sets) and high training \nvolume (>20 sets) groups. The main goal of this \nsystematic review with meta-analysis was to \ncompare moderate training volume vs. high \ntraining volume. Thus, six studies were included \nin the meta-analysis: those which included \nparticipants performing more than 12 weekly sets \nper muscle group, in order to compare moderate \nvolumes (12-20 sets) vs. high volumes (>20 sets). \nLow volume groups (<12 sets) were excluded \nfrom the quantitative analysis. \nStatistical analysis \nTraining interventions were classified as \n“high volume” (HV) if they included more than \n20 weekly sets per muscle group, and as \n“moderate volume” (MV) otherwise. Groups in \nMV performed between 12 and 20 sets per muscle \ngroup in the included studies. Standardized mean \ndifference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals \n(CIs) between MV and HV regimens were \ncalculated with RevMan 5.4 for macOS using the \nrandom effects model. Mean and SDs for the \noutcome measures were di rectly obtained from \nthe original studies. The significance for an overall \neffect was set at p < 0.05. Heterogeneity of the \nanalyzed studies was assessed using an I-squared \ntest, setting the significance level at p < 0.01. The \neffects of each regimen (i.e., MV or HV \ninterventions) were qualitatively assessed using \nthe following threshold values for the SMD: 0.25, \ntrivial; 0.25–0.50, small; 0.50–1.0, moderate; and \n>1.0, large. In some studies, more than one \nanalysis was carried out because they included \ns e v e r a l g r o u p s p e r f o r m i n g H V ( + 2 0 w e e k l y s e t s ) \n(Brigatto et al., 2019), and/or performed different \nmeasurements to explore muscle changes in the \ncase of quadriceps femoris (Aube et al., 2020). Three \n \n \ndifferent analysis (one per muscle group) were \nperformed to compare the effects of MV vs. HV in \nthe different measuremen ts. The first analysis \nexplored effects of MV and HV in the quadriceps \nfemoris muscle (including measurements of vastus \nlateralis, rectus femoris , and anterior thigh), while \nthe second and the third analysis explored these \neffects in biceps brachii and triceps brachii muscle, \nrespectively. \nResults \nStudy selection \n The search strategy yielded 2083 studies \nas presented in Figure 1. After removing 197 \nduplicates, and 1875 studies in the screening, 11 \nstudies were determined to be potentially relevant \nto the topic based on the information contained in \nthe abstract, from which only seven studies met \nthe inclusion criteria. Excluded studies had at \nleast one of the following characteristics: a) \nparticipants did not have enough training \nexperience or had left their training programs \nlong time ago and/or, b) there was only one \ntraining group, c) training sets were the same in \neach group, or d) the study was retracted from the \njournal (Figure 1). One study (Radaelli et al., 2015) \ndid not meet the inclusion criteria because \nparticipants had insufficient specific training \nexperience. Despite this, after analyzing the study \n(Radaelli et al., 2015) we realized that participants \nwere trained in calisthenics and lifted their body \nweight performing 5RM in the bench press \nexercise, which suggested that they had a \nsufficient training level. Taking all data into \naccount, all researchers agreed to include this \nstudy into the present systematic review with \nmeta-analysis. \n Finally, a total of seven studies which \ncomprised 19 intervention groups, were included \n(Table 2). In the meta-analysis a total of six studies \nand 14 intervention groups were included. In all \nstudies direct measurements were taken with \nultrasounds (muscle thickness) and results were \ndivided by measurements. \nLevel of evidence and quality of the studies \n According to the Oxford’s level of \nevidence, four of the included studies had an \nevidence level 1b (high quality randomized \ncontrolled trials). The three remaining studies had \na level of evidence 2b due to the following reason: \nless than 85% of participants completed the \n \n\n202 A systematic review of the effects of different resistance training volumes on muscle hypertrophy \nJournal of Human Kinetics - volume 81/2022 http://www.johk.pl \n \nprotocol. Scores from the PEDro scale were on \naverage 4.7 ± 1.1, and ranged from 3 to 6 (Table 1). \nQuadriceps femoris qualitative analysis \n In two out of the seven measurements \n(Brigatto et al., 2019; Schoenfeld et al., 2019a), \nsignificant differences between groups were \nobserved, favoring high training volume for \nquadriceps hypertrophy vs. the low training \nvolume group, and only in one study (Brigatto et \nal., 2019) significant differences between high and \nmedium training groups were observed. In these \nstudies, a larger effect size was observed, favoring \nthe high training volume group. In the four \nremaining measurements (Amirthalingam et al., \n2017; Aube et al., 2020), no significant differences \nwere observed between groups, and the effect size \ndid not favor any of the groups. Regarding the \nimprovement percentage, in four out of the seven \nmeasurements (Brigatto et al., 2019; Schoenfeld et \nal., 2019a; Aube et al., 2020), larger gains were \nobserved in the HV group (13.3, 9.4, 12.5 and \n13.7% respectively) and, in the other three \n(Amirthalingam et al., 2017; Aube et al., 2020), in \nthe MV groups (4.9, 6.9, 7.5% respectively). \n Interestingly, Scarpelli et al. (2020) \nreported significant differences between groups in \nthe increase in the cross-sectional area favoring \nthe group that performed an individualized \ntraining volume. Regarding individual responses, \nten participants (62.5% of the sample) had better \nresponses when individualizing their training, \ntwo participants had a better response when not \nindividualizing (12.5% of the sample), and four \nparticipants had a similar response (25% of the \nsample). \nQuadriceps femoris quantitative analysis \n The results classified between moderate \nand high volume are reported in Figure 2a. There \nwere no significant effects for volume ( p = 0.19); \nthe effect size was -0.2 (CI: -0.49, 0.10), favoring \nhigh training volume. I2 = 0 value represents a \nhigh degree of homogeneity. \nBiceps brachii qualitative analysis \n In two out of five st udies (Radaelli et al., \n2015; Schoenfeld et al., 2019a), significant \ndifferences were observed between groups, \nf a v o r i n g h i g h t r a i n i n g v o l u m e . I n o n e o f t h e m , \nsignificant differences were observed between HV \nand LV (Schoenfeld et al., 2019a), and in another \nstudy significant differences were observed \nbetween HV and MV, and between HV and LV \n \n \n(Radaelli et al., 2015). Among the remaining \nstudies, a larger effect size between groups was \nobserved in one of them, favoring the HV group \n(Brigatto et al., 2019); in another one, a larger \neffect size favoring the MV (Heaselgrave et al., \n2 0 1 9 ) ; a n d , i n t h e l a s t o n e , n o s i g n i f i c a n t \ndifferences were observed (Amirthalingam et al., \n2017). Regarding the improvement percentage, \nlarger gains in the HV group (17.5, 3, 6.9%) were \nobserved in three out of five studies (Brigatto et \nal., 2019; Radaelli et al., 2015; Schoenfeld et al., \n2019a), respectively, and in the MV group (7.2 and \n8.5%) in the remaining two (Amirthalingam et al., \n2017; Heaselgrave et al., 2019), respectively. \nBiceps brachii quantitative analysis \n Results classified between moderate and \nhigh volume are reported in Figure 2b. There \nwere no significant effects for volume ( p = 0.59). \nThe effect size was -0,1 (CI: -0.46, 0.26), favoring \nhigh training volume. The I2 = 14 value represents \na high degree of homogeneity. \nTriceps brachii qualitative analysis \n In two out of four studies (Brigatto et al., \n2019; Radaelli et al., 2015), significant differences \nbetween groups were observed, favoring HV. In \none of them (Brigatto et al., 2019), those \ndifferences were observed versus MV and, in \na n o t h e r , v e r s u s b o t h L V a n d M V ( R a d a e l l i e t a l . , \n2015). Among those studies in which no \nsignificant differences were observed between \ngroups, in one of them a larger effect size was \no b s e r v e d i n H V c o m p a r e d t o L V a n d M V \n(Schoenfeld et al., 2019a). Regarding the \nimprovement percentage, a clear dose-response \ntendency in training volume and muscle mass \ngains was observed. \nTriceps brachii quantitative analysis \nResults classified between moderate and high \nvolume are reported in Figure 2c. There were \nsignificant effects favoring high volume ( p = 0.01); \nthe effect size was -0.5 (CI: -0.88, 0.11), favoring \nhigh training volume.

    "discussion": "The main aim of this systematic review \nwith meta-analysis was to analyze the dose-\nresponse relationship between training volume \nand muscle mass gains under moderate and high-\nvolume conditions. After analyzing seven relevant \nstudies, we found that, although a favorable trend \ntowards high training volume exists (+20 sets per \nweek per muscle group), there were no \ndifferences between moderate and high training \nvolume responses for quadriceps femoris and \nbiceps brachii hypertrophy. However, it appears \nthat a high training volume is better to induce \nmuscle mass gains in the triceps brachii. \n Previous research, including Krieger \n(2010) and Schoenfeld et al. (2017), found a dose-\nresponse relationship between training volume \nand muscle hypertrophy. The main difference \nbetween those studies and the present one lies in \nthe comparison of the training volume. \nSchoenfeld et al. (2017) found that a volume over \nnine sets per week had a larger effect on muscle \nmass gains. Krieger (2010) compared the number \nof sets per exercise with its effects on \nhypertrophy. In the present systematic review \nwith meta-analysis, we made a comparison \nbetween 12-20 weekly sets (MV) and over 20 \nweekly sets (HV) to verify whether this dose-\nresponse relationship exists. In addition, these \ntwo aforementioned reviews included studies \nwith a highly heterogeneous sample, whereas the \npresent review was based on more restrictive \ninclusion criteria in order to have a more \nhomogeneous sample. \n The quadriceps femoris responses to \ntraining volume varied significantly. There were \nimprovements of 12.5 and 13.7% on average after \n8 weeks of high volume training (i.e. 45 \nquadriceps-direct weekly sets) (Schoenfeld et al., \n2019a), and between 1.6 and 13.3%, when \ncompleting 24 weekly sets (moderate volume) \nunder the same conditions (Aube et al., 2020). \nThese differences may be due to the participants' \nability and/or training frequency per muscle \ngroup. In the study by Schoenfeld et al. (2019a), \nparticipants trained with a weekly training \nfrequency of three per muscle group, whereas in \nthe study by Aube et al. (2020), the weekly \ntraining frequency was two per muscle group. \nThis suggests that high training volumes could be \ndistributed more optimally when using a higher \n \ntraining frequency, leading to greater muscle \nhypertrophy. \n In contrast, in the study by Brigatto et al. \n(2019) which had a frequency of 2, the HV2 group \n(32 weekly sets) reported improvements of 9.4% \non average, compared to 5.6% and 1.9% for HV1 \nand MV groups, respectively. Another relevant \nvariable to consider is the previous training \nvolume of the participants. As suggested by \nScarpelli et al. (2020), training volume \nindividualization is a key factor for muscle \nhypertrophy. In the study of Brigatto et al. (2019), \nthe HV2 group first performed 19 ± 7 sets of \nexercises focused on quadriceps per week, and \nthen they increased the volume to 32 weekly sets. \nInstead, the MV group jumped from 21 ± 13 \nweekly sets to 15. In the first case, the high \ntraining volume group increased 1.7 times their \nweekly volume, whereas the low training volume \ngroup had 0.7, which could suggest a larger \nresponse in the HV2 group due to that training \nvolume increase compared to the decrease which \nthe MV group experienced. Interestingly, Aube et \nal. (2020) found no significant differences between \ngroups regardless of the increase or decrease in \ntheir previous training volume. \n Quantifying training volume for muscles \nwhich are involved in multi-joint exercises such as \nthe biceps brachii or the triceps brachii can be \nespecially difficult. However, following the \nproposal of Schoenfeld et al. (2019b), all single \nand multi-joint sets have been quantified. In the \nstudy of Schoenfeld et al. (2019a) no direct biceps \nbrachii work was performed, in contrast with the \nrest of the studies. Radaelli et al. (2015) reported \nthe largest differences in terms of the muscle \nthickness increase in the biceps brachii, being 1.9, \n7.6 and 17.5% for the LV, MV and HV groups, \nrespectively, with statistically significant \ndifferences. In this case, the total training volume \nwas divided into 3 sessions, and the study \nduration was the longest of all the considered \nstudies (24 weeks). This tendency of increasing \ntraining frequency along with the volume was \nalso used by Heaselgrave et al. (2019), who \nreported larger gains in the MV compared to the \nLV group (8.5% and 3.8% respectively), and larger \ngains in the MV compared to the HV group (8.5% \nand 4.6%, respectively). An increase in the \ntraining frequency together with training volume \nin the HV could have been beneficial, according to \n \n\nby Eneko Baz-Valle et al. 207 \n© Editorial Committee of Journal of Human Kinetics \n \nSchoenfeld et al. (2019a). Amirthalingam et al. \n(2017), who used a frequency of 2, found that the \nMV group was favored when compared to the HV \ngroups (7.2% vs.0.8%, respectively). \n The only muscle group in which a clear \ndose-response relationship was observed is the \ntriceps brachii, showing larger gains in the HV \ngroup for the four studies which analyzed this \nmuscle. As such, three out of the four studies \nwhich included this measurement (Brigatto et al., \n2019; Radaelli et al., 2015; Schoenfeld et al., 2019a) \nreported a favorable tendency to high training \nvolume in most measurements, and probably the \nlack of measurements in the triceps brachii in the \nrest of the studies could be one of the reasons \nexplaining these results. Ju st like with the biceps \nbrachii, when all the trai ning volume is counted, \nthe direct training volume of the triceps brachii is \nless. However, as suggested by recent studies, \nsuch as Brandão et al. (2020), the growth of the \ntriceps brachii is not uniform, and multi-joint \nexercises can affect more the lateral head, and \nsingle-joint exercises the long head. This suggests \nthat a combination of these is important for \ntriceps brachii hypertro phy and that, depending \non where the measurements are taken (in the \ntriceps brachii), results may vary due to regional \nhypertrophy (Zabaleta-Korta et al., 2020). \n Another reason to explain why greater \nresults in HV are observed in the triceps brachii, \nas suggested by Brandão et al. (2020), is that the \ntriceps brachii acts as a synergist and not as an \nagonist in many of the multi-joint exercises. \nTherefore, it may be necessary to build up a larger \ntraining volume with multi-joint exercises in \norder to achieve the same results. Interestingly, \nalthough there is lack of direct evidence regarding \nresistance training volume and fiber-type \nhypertrophy, and even acknowledging that \ndifferent rep ranges do not necessarily affect \nhypertrophy in different fiber types (Schoenfeld et \nal., 2020), previous research suggests that type I \nmuscle fibers tolerate higher amounts of training \nvolume (Lievens et al., 2020). This contrasts with \nthe results of the present meta-analysis, as the \ntriceps brachii, which contains a higher \nproportion of type II fibe r s ( J o h n s o n e t a l . , 1 9 7 3 ; \nTerzis et al., 2003) should have responded worse \nto higher training volumes. \nLastly, we have to acknowledge that \nincreasing the number of sets is not the only way \n \n \nof increasing the training volume, as advanced \nresistance training techniques such as drop sets, \ncluster sets and others could be very useful when \naiming at muscle hypertrophy (Krzysztofik et al., \n2019). These types of techniques, together with the \nmanagement of repetition tempos, may increase \nthe effective TUT (Maszczyk et al., 2020; Wilk et \nal., 2019) and thus, the acute increase in \nphysiological responses (Wilk et al., 2018) may \nultimately lead to further hypertrophy \nadaptations (Wilk et al., 2020). \n The following review faced several \nlimitations: 1) The number of included studies is \nsmall. 2) There was no standardization between \nmoderate and high volume in the studies \nincluded, which makes a direct comparison \nbetween them more difficult. Therefore, it was \ndifficult to compare the medium- and high-\nvolume protocols with those of the low volume \ndue to the lack of grou ps performing training \nvolumes of less than 10 weekly sets per muscle \ngroup. 3) Quadriceps femoris measurements were \nnot consistent across the studies. Measurements of \nthe frontal thigh, vastus lateralis and rectus \nfemoris have been taken, as well as measurements \nfrom different areas (distal, proximal and total), \nand all have been used in the comparison. 4) The \ncalorie intake and supplementation by the \nparticipants was not reported in most of the \nstudies analyzed, being an important point in \nmuscle hypertrophy",
    "conclusions": "Training volume recommendations are \nbased on studies comparing different schemes of \ntraining volumes when performing sets at \nmaximum effort (i .e., muscular failure), with the \nexception of the study by Aube et al. (2020), in \nwhich each set was performed with 2 repetitions \nin reserve and the last one to muscle failure. \nTherefore, it seems that the optimum training \nvolume range for quadrice ps and biceps brachii \nhypertrophy lays somewhere between 12-20 \nweekly sets when training each muscle group \ntwice per week, without additional benefits of \nincreasing training volume. Increasing the \ntraining frequency of these muscle groups could \nallow for more training volume to be successfully \nperformed. \n On the other hand, training volumes \nhigher than 20 weekly sets seem to be more \neffective for triceps brachii muscle gains. We have \n \n\n208 A systematic review of the effects of different resistance training volumes on muscle hypertrophy \nJournal of Human Kinetics - volume 81/2022 http://www.johk.pl \n \nto note that volume from multi-joint exercises also \ncounted for the triceps brachii training volume, \nthus 12-20 weekly sets of direct triceps brachii \nwork may be optimum. In line with the \nsuggestions for the biceps brachii and the \nquadriceps, increasing the training frequency \nwould allow for a greater amount of triceps \n \nbrachii training volume. According to the results \nof this review, a range of 12-20 weekly sets per \nmuscle group may be an optimum standard \nrecommendation for increasing muscle \nhypertrophy in young, trained men. \n \n \nReferences \nAmirthalingam, T., Mavros, Y., Wilson, G.
