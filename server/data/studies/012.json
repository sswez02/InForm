Comparisons between multi-\nvariate RT prescriptions are needed to advance optimal RTx \nguidelines.\nPairwise meta-\n analyses are \nmethodologically constrained \nto only comparing two RTxs. 28 Several RTxs are conceiv-\nable, and multiple pairwise meta-\n analyses are unlikely \nto yield \ncongruent insights. Network meta-\n analysis (NMA) expands on \npairwise \nmeta-\n analysis \nby permitting the simultaneous compar -\nison of multiple treatments. 29 NMA leverages direct and indi-\nrect evidence to produce enhanced effect estimates between \nall treatments, even when some comparisons have never been \ntested in randomised trials.\n30 Additionally, NMA permits the \nrank-\n ordering of \nall included treatments and the incorporation \nof data from multi-\n arm \ntrials.28 Within exercise science, NMA \nhas been used to compare different types of exercise31–34; within \nRT, NMA has only been used to compare different load doses.35 \nImportantly, NMA can compare several multivariate RTxs.\nThe purpose of this systematic review and NMA was to deter-\nmine how different RTxs affect muscle strength, hypertrophy \nand physical function in healthy adults. Specifically, we sought \nto compare distinct combinations of RTx variables—load, sets \nand frequency—and non-\n ex\nercising control groups. For each \noutcome, we used NMA to integrate data from randomised \ntrials.\nMETHODS\nProtocol and registration\nThis review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting \nItems for Systematic Reviews and Meta-\n Analyses extension \nstatement for network meta-\n analyses (PRISMA-\n NMA)36 and \nCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.37 \nThe PRISMA-\n NMA checklist \nis provided in online supplemental \nappendix 1. This review combines NMAs registered in the Inter-\nnational Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (https://\nwww.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/).\nEligibility criteria\nThe eligibility criteria are detailed in table 1 . Only trials that \nincluded healthy adults ≥18 years old, were randomised, \ncompared at least 2 of 13 unique conditions (box\n 1\n), and \nmeasured muscle strength, size and/or physical function were \nincluded. Physical function was subdivided into three domains: \nmobility, the ability to physically move; balance, the ability to \nmaintain a body position during a task; and gait speed, the time \ntaken to locomote over a given distance. T rials that included \nathletes, persons with comorbidities or military persons; \nspanned <6 weeks; involved unsupervised RT (eg, home-\n based \nex\nercise); were reported in a non-\n English language; or were \nnon-\n randomised were ex\ncluded.\nCondition coding framework\nArms of included studies were classified as 1 of 12 RTxs or non- \nex\nercise control (CTRL). Each RTx was classified based on the \nload, set and frequency prescription (box\n \n1). RTxs were denoted \nwith a three-\n character acronym—XY#—where X is load (H, \n≥80% \none-\n repetition \nmaximum (1RM); L, <80% 1RM); Y is \nsets (M, multiset; S, single-\n set); and # is the weekly \nfrequency \n(3, ≥3 days/week; 2, 2 days/week; 1, 1 day/week), respectively. \nFor example, HM2 denotes higher-\n load, multiset, twice-\n weekly \nR\nT within this framework. CTRL was comprised of subjects who \nreceived no intervention.\nSearch strategy\nMEDLINE, Embase, Emcare, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL and Web \nof Science were systematically searched until 7 February 2022. \nMultiple experts developed the search strategy, which included \nsubject headings and keywords specific to the research question \nand each database. No language nor study design limits were used \nin the search strategy. The complete search strategy is provided \nin online supplemental appendix 2. Relevant systematic reviews \n(online supplemental appendix 3) were manually selected, and \nthe references were scrutinised for eligibility.\nStudy selection and data extraction\nAll records underwent title/abstract screening by two indepen-\ndent reviewers, with discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer. \nThe full text of potentially eligible reports was then assessed \nfor inclusion by two independent reviewers, with discrepancies \nresolved by a third reviewer. Reports deemed eligible for inclu-\nsion then underwent data extraction.\nData from included studies were extracted independently by \npairs of reviewers, with any discrepancies resolved by consensus \nwith a third reviewer (BSC or JCM). Extracted data included \nstudy and participant characteristics, RTx details and measure-\nments of muscle strength and/or size (online supplemental \nappendix 4). Measures of mobility, balance and/or gait speed \nwere extracted when the mean participant age was ≥55 years \nold. Authors of studies with missing data were contacted twice \nwith a request for the missing data. The systematic review \nsoftware Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, \nAustralia. Available at www.covidence.org) was used for record \nscreening and data extraction.\nMean change from baseline and SD change (SD\nchange) from base-\nline were the outcomes of interest and extracted when reported. \nWhen unreported, SD was calculated with SEs, CIs, p values or \nt-\n \nstatistics,37 and SDchange was imputed from pre- SD and post- SD \nvalues \nwith a correlation coefficient of 0.5.35 RT loads reported \nas repetition maximum (RM) were converted to a percentage \nof one-\n repetition \nmaximum (%1RM) with the equation: \n%1RM=100−(RM(2.5)).38 The highest- ranked measurement \nwas extracted, per predetermined hierarchy (online supple-\nmental appendix 5), when multiple measurements were reported \nfor a single outcome (eg, MRI and ultrasonography for muscle \nsize). The longest period that all conditions were unchanged \nfrom baseline was analysed when the outcome(s) of interest were \nmeasured at multiple time points.\n37 Cohorts randomised sepa-\nrately but reported together (eg, young and old39) were analysed \nindependently. Within-\n group \noutcomes reported by participant \nsex were grouped by condition.37 40\nRisk of bias\nReviewers independently evaluated the within- study risk of bias \nusing the Cochrane Risk of Bias V .2.0. tool.41 Signalling questions \nand criteria were followed to inform the risk of bias appraisals \nfor the intention-\n to-\n treat effect. \nArticles were assessed in dupli-\ncate at the strength and hypertrophy outcome level for bias: (1) \nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n. by guest on December 3, 2025 http://bjsm.bmj.com/Downloaded from 6 July 2023. 10.1136/bjsports-2023-106807 on Br J Sports Med: first published as \n\n3 of 12\nCurrier BS, et al.

Every domain was determined to be of high, \nmoderate (some concerns) or low risk of bias, and studies were \nsubsequently given an overall classification of high, moderate or \nlow risk of bias. Any disagreement was resolved by consensus \n(BSC and JCM).\nStatistical analysis\nStandardised mean differences (SMD), adjusted for small- \nsa\nmple size bias, 42 were calculated as the summary statistic \nbecause each outcome was measured with various tools. 37 \nThe direction of effect was standardised to analyse mobility, \ngait speed and balance to ensure consistency of desirable \noutcomes.\n43 When multiple studies compared two condi -\ntions, random- e\nffects pairwise meta-\n a\nnalyses were conducted \nto identify comparison- l\nevel heterogeneity, publication bias, \noutliers and influential cases. 40 44 T o account for within- tri al \ncorrelations in multi- a\nrm trials (≥3 conditions), the SE in \nthe base/reference arm was calculated as the square root \nof the covariance between calculated effects,\n45 assuming a \ncorrelation of 0.5 between effect sizes. 46\nNMA integrated all direct evidence, with one network \nconstructed for each outcome. NMA models were fitted \nwithin a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte \nCarlo methods. 47 Four chains were run with non- i nformative \npriors. There were 50\n 000 i\nterations per chain; the first \n20\n 000 \nwere discarded as burn- i\nn iterations. Values were \ncollected with a thinning interval of 10. Convergence was \nevaluated by visual inspection of trace plots\n48 and the poten-\ntial scale reduction factor. Both fixed- e\nffects and random- \ne\nffects models were fit, and the more parsimonious model \nwas used for analysis. 49 Model fit was assessed with the \ndeviance information criterion (DIC) and posterior mean \nresidual deviance.\n49 50 Heterogeneity was assessed by exam-\nining the between- stu\ndy SD ( τ) and 95% credible intervals \n(95% CrI). Global inconsistency was assessed by comparing \nmodel fit, DIC and variance parameters between the NMA \nmodel and an unrelated mean effects (UME) model.\n51 Local \ninconsistency was assessed with the node- spl\nitting method, 52 \nand inconsistency was considered to be detected when the \nBayesian p value<0.05. Forest plots and league tables were \ngenerated to display relative effects. Surface under the cumu -\nlative ranking curve values were used to rank-\n orde\nr each \ncondition from top- to- b\nottom; additionally, the probability \nof each condition ranking in the top three was calculated as \na percentage of the area under the curve. NMA results were \npresented as posterior SMD and 95% CrI, interpreted as a \nrange in which a parameter lies with a 95% probability.\n53\nTable 1 Study inclusion and exclusion criteria\nInclusion criteria Exclusion criteria\nPopulation\n ► Humans ≥18 years old.\n ► Generally healthy (no disease condition indicated other than sarcopenia).\n ► Community-\n \ndwelling adults.\nIntervention\n ► Upper\n-\n body,\n lower-\n body and/or whole-\n body resistance training.\n ► R\nTx aligns with one predefined node; specifically, exercises performed:\n ► with high(H;\n ≥80% 1\n RM or ≥8 RM) or low(L;\n <80% 1\n RM or >8 RM) load,\n AND\n ► for a single (S) or multiple (M) sets\n, AND\n ► once-\n weekly (1),\n twice-\n weekly (2) or at least thrice-\n weekly (3).\n ► Intervention duration ≥6 weeks\n.\nComparison\n ► R\nTx variable (load, sets or frequency) differentially prescribed between training groups\n ► Eligible R\nTx compared with CTRL.\nOutcome\n ► Eligible outcome(s) assessed pre-\n intervention and post-\n intervention.\nMuscle strength:\n ► 1RM test.\n ► Isometric maximum voluntary contraction.\n ► Isokinetic maximum voluntary contraction.\nMuscle size:\n Fat-\n free mass\n, fat-\n free and bone-\n free mass\n, lean mass, whole-\n muscle cross-\n sectional area or volume or \nthickness or muscle fibre cross-\n sectional area.\n Eligible measurement instruments:\n ► Ultrasonography.\n ► MRI.\n ► C\nT.\n ► Bioelectrical impedance\n.\n ► Dual-\n \nenergy X-\n \nray absorptiometry.\n ► Hydrostatic weighing.\n ► Air displacement plethysmography.\n ► Microscopy.\nPhysical function:\n Assessed physical function in older adults (mean age ≥55 years old) in the domain(s):\n ► Mobility:\n (defined as a person’s ability to move physically, eg, Timed Up and Go Test, Chair Rise Sit to Stand).\n ► Balance:\n (defined as the ability to maintain a controlled body position during a given task, eg, Berg Balance Test, \nSit and Reach Test).\n ► Gait speed:\n (defined as the time it takes to cover a given distance, eg, 6 Minute Walk Test, or 25 Foot Walk Test).\nStudy design\n ► Randomised trial\n.\n ► Reported in English.\nP\nopulation\n ► Non-\n \nhuman species.\n ► <18 years old.\n ► P\nersons with or at risk for comorbidities (eg, \ncardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, type \nI diabetes, cancer, peripheral artery disease, \nosteoarthritis).\n ► P\nersons that are injured (eg, musculoskeletal-\n related \nfracture and/or repair).\n ► Athletes or military personnel\n.\n ► Explicitly mentions obese and/or overweight \nparticipants\n.\n ► Individuals that are hospitalised (inpatient/outpatient/\nrehabilitation).\n ► Individuals living in long-\n term care homes\n.\nIntervention\n ► Resistance training involved added intervention (eg,\n \nblood flow restriction)\n ► R\nTx does not align with one node (eg, load 60–90% \n1RM).\n ► Explicitly mentions unsupervised resistance training.\n ► Resistance training familiarisation/lead-\n in >4 weeks\n.\n ► CTRL received treatment beyond habitual lifestyle (eg,\n \nnutritional advice, lifestyle consultation).\nComparison\n ► Eligible R\nTx not compared with another eligible RTx \nnor CTRL.\nOutcome\n ► No measure of muscle strength,\n size, mobility, gait \nspeed or balance.\nStudy design\n ► Non-\n \nrandomised trials.\n ► Systematic reviews (ie\n, systematic reviews; meta-\n \nanalyses review;\n meta-\n regressions;\n umbrella reviews; \nnetwork meta-\n \nanalyses).\n ► Narrative reviews\n.\n ► Observ\national studies (eg, retrospective, prospective \nor longitudinal).\nCTRL, non-\n exercise control;\n 1RM, one-\n repetition maximum;\n RTx, resistance training prescription.\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n. by guest on December 3, 2025 http://bjsm.bmj.com/Downloaded from 6 July 2023. 10.1136/bjsports-2023-106807 on Br J Sports Med: first published as \n\n4 of 12\nCurrier BS, et al.

Threshold analysis determines how \nmuch the included evidence could change—for any reason—be-\nfore treatment recommendations differ and identifies the subse-\nquent treatment recommendation.\n55 Identifying the robustness \nof results with threshold analysis permits guideline devel-\nopers to have appropriate confidence levels in the reported \nrecommendations.\nSensitivity analysis and network meta-regression\nSensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of \noutliers, influential cases and sources of network inconsistency \non model fit, relative effects and treatment rankings.

For compar-\nisons between RTxs (ie, not CTRL), the 95% CrI excluded zero \nfor 13.6% (9/66) and 2.2% (1/45) of comparisons in the strength \nand hypertrophy NMA, respectively. For muscle strength, there \nwas a 95% probability that HM2 yields a larger relative effect \nthan LS1, LS2, LS3, LM2 and LM3 and that HM3 yields a larger \nrelative effect than LS2, LS3, LM2 and LM3. There was a 95% \nprobability for muscle hypertrophy that HM2 yields a larger \nrelative effect than LS3.\nRanking conditions\nFigure 4 displays the probability that each condition would \nrank \nin the top three best interventions for muscle strength and \nhypertrophy, such that scores closer to 100% indicate a greater \nchance of ranking in the top three. HM3 (85.5%), HM2 (83.5%) \nand HM1 (60.5%) were most likely to rank in the top three for \nmuscle strength. HM2 (86.9%), LM1 (48.7%) and LM2 (48.3%) \nwere most likely to rank in the top three for muscle hypertrophy. \nCTRL was the only condition with a 0% chance for strength and \nhypertrophy. Posterior rankings and distribution curves for all \nconditions are reported in the online supplemental appendix 8.\nNetwork inconsistency\nModel fit outputs and node- splitting plots are reported in the \nonline supplemental appendix 9. In the strength network, the \nUME model (DIC=402.3) was not meaningfully different than \nthe random-\n effects \nNMA model (DIC=400.8). Node-\n splitting \nwas \nperformed on 29 comparisons; the only significant difference \nwas LM1 versus HM1 (p<0.01). In the hypertrophy network, \nthe UME model (DIC=143.1) was meaningfully different than \nthe random-\n effects \nNMA model (DIC=137.8). Node-\n splitting \nwas performed \non 22 comparisons; the only significant differ -\nence was LS2 versus CTRL (p<0.01).\nThreshold analysis\nThreshold analysis results for strength and hypertrophy are \nshown in online supplemental appendix 10. HM3 was the top-\n \nranked condition for strength; \nhowever, 65 comparisons indi-\ncated some sensitivity to the level of uncertainty and potential \nbiases in the evidence. The revised top-\n ranked strength \ncondition \nwas HM2 in 92% (60/65) or HM1 in 8% (5/65) of comparisons. \nHM2 was the top-\n ranked \ncondition for hypertrophy, and this \nfinding was robust. T wo comparisons indicated some sensitivity \nto the level of uncertainty and potential biases in the evidence, \nand HM1 was the revised top-\n ranked condition in both cases.\nSensitivity analyses\nSensitivity analysis results are displayed in the online supple-\nmental appendix 11. For both the strength and hypertrophy \nNMAs, the second sensitivity analysis (discussed herein) most \nimproved model fit. The strength network included 155 studies \n(n=4397) and 11 conditions (LS1 and HS1 excluded). The rela-\ntive effects for all RTx versus CTRL were tempered, such that \nposterior SMDs ranged from 0.77 to 1.49, with the largest rela-\ntive effect from HM2 (1.49 (1.29 to 1.70)) and smallest from \nLS3 (0.77 (0.56 to 0.98)). The 95% CrI for each RTx versus \nCTRL excluded zero. There was a 95% probability that HM2 \nyields larger relative effects than LS2, LS3, LM1, LM2, LM3 \nand HS3; that HM3 was superior to LS2, LS3, LM1, LM2 and \nLM3; and that LM2 was superior to LS3. HM2 (99.9%) and \nHM3 (95.7%) remained most likely to rank in the top three for \nmuscle strength.\nThe hypertrophy network included 115 studies (n=3240) and \n9 conditions (HS2 and HM1 excluded). The relative effect for \neach RTx versus CTRL was roughly unchanged, with the largest \nrelative effect from HM2 (0.59 (0.39 to 0.78)) and the smallest \nfrom HS3 (0.30 (−0.05 to 0.66)). Between prescriptions, there \nwas a 95% probability that LM2 was superior to LS3. HM2 \n(82.8%) and LM2 (80.4%) remained most likely to rank in the \ntop three for muscle hypertrophy.\nNetwork meta-regression\nNetwork meta- regression results are displayed in the online \nsupplemental appendix 12. Model fit was not meaningfully \ndifferent than the unadjusted model for all \ncovariates, except \nrelative weekly volume load, which worsened model fit. Age, \ntraining status, proportion of females, duration, volitional \nfatigue, relative weekly volume load, outcome measurement \ntool, outcome measurement region and publication year did \nnot yield any obvious modifying effect on the relative effect for \neach RTx versus CTRL, and data-\n sparse \nnodes reduced estimate \nprecision.\nPhysical function\nPhysical function results are reported in the online supplemental \nappendix 13. Few studies assessed mobility (25 studies, n=859, \nage (mean)=68 years), gait speed (15 studies, n=488, 68 years) \nand balance/flexibility (11 studies, n=323, 68 years). Compared \nwith CTRL, there was a 95% probability that LM2, LM3 and \nHM3 improved mobility and gait speed, while HM3 was the \nonly condition that improved balance/flexibility (figure\n \n5). No \ndifferences were found between RT prescriptions for any phys-\nical function outcome.",
    "discussion": "T welve distinct RT prescriptions and non- ex ercising control \ngroups were compared using network meta-\n analysis to deter -\nmine their effect on gains in muscle \nstrength, hypertrophy and \nimprovements in physical function in healthy adults. Compared \nwith no exercise, most load, sets and frequency combinations \nincreased muscle strength and hypertrophy, indicating that \nseveral RTx resulted in beneficial skeletal muscle adaptations. \nRT with higher loads characterised the top-\n ranked strength \nprescriptions, \nand RT with multiple sets characterised the \ntop-\n ranked hypertrophy \nprescriptions. A diverse range of RT \nprescriptions improved physical function, but evidence scar -\ncity limited insights. Guideline developers and practitioners \nmay consider these results when forming recommendations and \nprescribing RT for healthy adults.\nNetwork meta-\n analysis has previously been used to compare \ndifferent types of ex\nercise31–34 and doses of RT load. 35 In the \nNMA by Lopez et al,35 23 (n=582) and 24 (n=604) studies were \nincluded in the strength and hypertrophy networks, respectively. \nThe present strength (178 studies, n=5097) and hypertrophy \n(119 studies, n=3364) networks were much larger, and this is \nlikely attributable to Lopez et al\n35 excluding studies not including \nRT to momentary muscular failure and our more comprehensive \nsearch strategy (2629\n35 vs 16 880 records identified).

There was a 95% \nprobability that RT with at least two sets or two sessions per \nweek increased strength (figure\n \n3A), and training with at least \ntwo sets and two sessions per week resulted in hypertrophy \n(figure\n 3B\n). Considering only the lower credible interval limit, \neach RTx induced at least a moderate (SMD>0.47) and small \n(SMD>0.16) increase in muscle strength and mass, respectively. \nSuch certainty is not possible for all prescriptions, though, \nbecause the 95% CrI crossed zero for two RTx for strength \n(HS1 and LS1) and three RTx for hypertrophy (HM1, HS2 and \nHS3), meaning these prescriptions might increase, not change \nor decrease muscle strength and size. However, we posit that \nthis is unlikely to represent an ineffectiveness of those partic-\nular RTx and that imprecise network estimates confound these \nfindings. These strength (HS1 and LS1) and hypertrophy (HM1, \nHS2 and HS3) nodes included <60 participants and contrib-\nuted little direct evidence (figure\n 2\n). Within each study testing \nthese prescriptions, strength increased significantly compared \nwith CTRL/baseline in all cases and hypertrophy increased from \nbaseline in most cases. Those prescribing RT can be confident \nthat all RTxs increased strength and hypertrophy compared with \nno exercise.\nNetwork comparisons suggest that most RT prescriptions \nwere comparable for strength and hypertrophy. The 95% CrI \ncontained zero for a striking 91% (101/111) of all between-\n R\nTx \ncomparisons (table\n 2\n). Nine of the 10 comparisons that did not \ncontain zero were between HM2 or HM3 and a lower-\n load \nR\nTx for strength, suggesting higher-\n load, \nmultiset programmes \ncaused the largest strength gains. This result remained after sensi-\ntivity analyses (online supplemental appendix 11) and aligned \nwith previous meta-\n analyses that found higher\n-\n load R\nT yields \nthe largest strength gains.17 18 35 A critical point for practitioners \nis that lower-\n load R\nT prescriptions increase strength compared \nwith no exercise. All RT prescriptions may comparably promote \nmuscle hypertrophy, and the influence of load was less apparent. \nThe lack of importance of load for hypertrophy is supported \nby other analyses,\n16 17 35 62 but performing RT to momentary \nmuscular failure (fatigue) has been posited as a key component \nfor RT-\n induced hypertrophy \nwith lower loads.62 Network meta- \nregression \nfor exercise ‘failure’ (fatigue) did not improve model \nfit nor substantially alter network estimates, suggesting that \nlifting to fatigue does not suitably explain the observed hypertro-\nphic response. Our finding in this domain agrees with previous \nwork,\n63 suggesting that untrained individuals still achieve large \ngains in skeletal muscle mass without performing RT to failure. \nPerforming RT to momentary muscular failure may, however, \nbe increasingly important for trained individuals.\n13 For both \nstrength and hypertrophy, though, there was a large credible \ninterval surrounding the non-\n significant \neffect estimate for many \ncomparisons between RTxs, so a wide range of different effects \nare possible for these comparisons. The available evidence does \nnot permit definitive, statistically valid",
    "conclusions": "about the \nequivalency of each RTx, despite most comparisons between \nRTxs not being statistically significantly different from each \nother.\nPrescriptions for RT with higher loads were more likely to \nrank in the top three for strength than all lower-\n load prescrip\n-\ntions, and RT prescriptions with multiple sets per exercise were \nmost likely to rank in the top three for hypertrophy (figure\n \n4). \nRankings are sensitive to uncertainties within the network, 28 \nbut posterior ranking credible intervals supported higher-\n load, \nmultiset program\nmes being the highest-\n ranked for strength \nand \nmultiple sets or multiple sessions being the highest-\n ranked for \nhypertrophy\n. Notably, sets and frequency are major components \nof RT volume, a key factor for hypertrophy. 21 64–66 The proba-\nbility of each condition ranking in the top three was calculated \nbecause the top-\n ranked R\nTx does not necessarily reflect the best \nintervention for all individuals.67 Personal preferences, including \ndisliking higher loads or time constraints, including an inability \nto train more than once weekly, can be observed while still bene-\nfiting from RT. In our view, especially given the low participa-\ntion rates in RT, practitioners should not avoid prescribing, nor \nshould individuals be discouraged from completing non-\n top-\n \nranked R\nTx. While all prescriptions increased muscle strength \nand mass, the top-\n ranked prescriptions involved higher loads for \nstrength and higher volume for hypertrophy\n. We do not know \nhow these RTx affect relevant health outcomes. Some data \nsuggest that health benefits exist with low time commitment \n(30–60\n min/week) \nto RT and greater time commitment with \nreduced health benefits.4 68\nOurs is the first review to assess confidence in RTx recom-\nmendations with threshold analysis.

The top-\n ranked \nR\nTx for hypertrophy—HM2—was sensitive to the uncertainty \nof only two comparisons, and HM1 was the revised recommen-\ndation because both comparisons were from the same multi-\n arm \nstudy\n.72 Furthermore, 127 of the 161 direct comparisons would \nneed to change by more than four SDs to alter HM2 as the top \nrecommendation for hypertrophy.

Most individuals do not \nmeet current guidelines, and RTx complexities may impede the \nadoption of RT. Minimal-\n dose approaches have been proposed \nto reduce barriers to R\nT,74 and our results strongly support the \nWHO’s claim, ‘Doing some activity is better than none’.73 While \nothers attempt to optimise RTx, 75 we propose that, for most \nadults, regularly engaging in any RTx is more important than \ntraining to optimise strength and hypertrophy outcomes.

Well-\n trained \nelite athletes/military persons \nand individuals with chronic \ndisease were excluded, so the results should be translated to these \npopulations with caution and additional insights.\n13 77–79 Mobility, \ngait speed and balance/flexibility findings should also be inter -\npreted with caution due to the limited evidence available, which \ncould be attributed to including only healthy older (>55\n year) \nadults \n(eg, not frail). The coding framework for RT prescrip-\ntions prevented the inclusion of periodized RT programmes \nFigure 5 F orest plots displaying network estimates for relative \neffects of resistance training prescriptions versus non-\n exercising control \nfor mobility (A),\n gait speed (B) and balance/flexibility.

Br J Sports Med 2023;57:1211–1220. doi:10.1136/bjsports-2023-106807\nSystematic review\noverlapping conditions (eg, loads ranging from 60–90% 1RM) \nfrom being captured in the network. Initially, our objective \nwas to further divide the load and set prescriptions; however, \nthis yielded sparse, disconnected networks, violating a critical \nassumption of NMA.\n49 The continuous RTx variables investi-\ngated herein (load, sets, frequency) were classified categorically, \nso future work could use dose-\n response/model-\n based NMA \nmethods \nto explore these RTx variables as continuous predic-\ntors.80 81 Several acute RT variables were not factored into the \nincluded RT prescriptions (eg, inter-\n set rest, time under tension, \nrepetition velocity\n, volitional fatigue, tempo); where possible, \nNMR was used to explore if these factors improved model fit \nand altered effects. Results from NMR are correlative, however, \nand should be interpreted cautiously.\n82 Nonetheless, many vari-\nables (inter-\n set rest, tempo, time under tension) were \nreported \ntoo infrequently for inclusion as covariates. Calculating the rela-\ntive weekly volume load (ie, load × repetitions/set × number of \nsets × number of exercises × weekly frequency), which should \nimpact results,\n21 also required approximations that hindered \nmodel fit. The principle of specificity17 (ie, the similarity between \ntraining and testing movement) and approximations of muscle \nmass (,\n83 eg, lean mass) could infringe on transitivity assump-\ntions37 when integrating results from multiple studies and NMR \nwith the covariates measurement tool and region were imper -\nfect solutions. Including one measurement per outcome for each \nstudy may limit the totality of evidence captured by this review, \nso future methodological work could explore the integration of \nmultiple correlated effect sizes in NMA, as in recent pairwise \nmeta-\n \nanalyses.63 84 Increasingly, within- subject models are used \ndue to their increased statistical\n power. 85 T o our knowledge, \nhowever, no methods are available to account for the additional \ncorrelation when including within-\n subject \nand between-\n subject \ncomparisons \nin NMA. With consideration for these limitations, \nguideline developers and practitioners can obtain meaningful \ninsights from this analysis.\nConclusion\nThis NMA represents the largest synthesis of RTx data from \nrandomised trials. Most RTx increased muscle strength and mass \ncompared with no exercise. T op-\n ranked prescriptions \nfor muscle \nstrength were characterised by lifting heavier loads, and multiple \nsets characterised top-\n ranked prescriptions for muscle hyper -\ntrophy\n. Guideline developers and practitioners should encourage \nthe adoption of RT since all RTx can increase muscle strength \nand mass in healthy adults. The effects on health outcomes of \nvarious RTx remain largely unknown.\nTwitter Brad S Currier @brad_currier and Stuart M Phillips @mackinprof\nAcknowledgements\n T\nhe authors thank Alicia Wong for assistance with the risk \nof bias assessments.
