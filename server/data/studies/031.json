Sports Medicine - Open (2024) 10:58 \nKey Points \nTraining status is an important factor influencing the effects of the BFR-RT.\nTrained individuals may obtain greater muscle strength and hypertrophy gains in BFR-RT compared to HL-RT.\nUntrained individuals may experience a smaller increase in strength and a similar increase in hypertrophy with BFR-RT \ncompared to HL-RT.\nKeywords Blood flow restriction training, High-load resistance training, Training effect, Strength, Hypertrophy, \nTraining status, Protocol characteristics, Test specificity, Meta-analysis\nBackground\nHigh-load resistance training (HL-RT) has long been \nconsidered as the “gold standard” protocol to increase \nmuscle strength and mass. It has been suggested \nthat ≥ 65% one-repetition maximum (1RM) is required \nto increase strength and hypertrophy [1–3]. However, \nmounting evidence indicates that the use of low-load \nresistance training (< 50% 1RM) combined with blood \nflow restriction (BFR-RT) results in strength and mor -\nphological responses [4]. The results of a previous study \nshowed that low load resistance training with and with -\nout blood flow resulted in similar adaptations when sets \nof exercise were taken to failure [5], however the results \nof multiple studies showed the superiority of BFR-RT \nin terms of gains in muscle strength and hypertrophy \nwhen compared with similar low-load resistance training \nwithout blood flow restriction [6–8]. However, the liter -\nature is controversial about the magnitude of the adapta -\ntions when comparing BFR-RT to HL-RT. For example, \nsome studies have reported greater increases in muscle \nstrength for HL-RT when comparing to BFR-RT [9–13], \nwhile others have suggested similar gains between the \ntwo exercise protocols [14–17]. Moreover, some studies \nhave reported that BFR-RT has higher muscle strength \ngains than HL-RT [18, 19]. Some studies compared the \neffects of BFR-RT and HL-RT through meta-analysis \n[20, 21]. In the meta-analysis by Lixandrão et  al., they \nobserved that BFR-RT and HL-RT have similar gains in \nmuscle hypertrophy, while HL-RT is more effective in \nincreasing muscle strength [20]. However, limited by the \nnumber of studies comparing BFR and HL-RT at that \ntime, some important potential moderators (e.g., training \nfrequency, etc.) could not be further explored [20].\nThe increase in muscle strength is the result of the \ncoordination of nerve and muscle systems [22]. It is \nbelieved that neural adaptation dominates early in the \ntraining programme; later, as neural adaptations reach a \nplateau, muscular adaptation (hypertrophy) dominates \n[23]. At this stage, in intermediate and advanced train -\ning, progress is limited to the extent of muscular adapta -\ntion that can be achieved [23]. It has been believed that \nBFR-RT provides a potential time-effective approach to \nstimulate muscle adaptations [8, 24, 25], and even well-\ntrained athletes may benefit from BFR-RT [26]. Thus, \ncompared to HL-RT, training status and training duration \nmay be a key factor affecting the effectiveness of BFR-RT. \nAdditionally, the results of several studies have showed \nthat compared with HL-RT, BFR-RT induced less hyper -\ntrophy in the proximal region [17, 27, 28]. Therefore, this \nregional specificity may be another influencing factor. \nFinally, HL-RT implies high-load exercise, which is simi -\nlar to specific strength assessments (i.e., 1RM test), while \nduring BFR-RT, participants are never exposed to high \nloads [29]. Thus, non-specific strength assessments (i.e., \nisometric or isokinetic tests) may more accurately reflect \nthe response to the low-load training protocols [29]. In \nthis regard, test specificity may also affect the results.\nIn short, the inconsistencies in the literature regarding \neffects of BFR-RT compared with HL-RT on the muscle \nstrength and hypertrophy justify the need for synthesis \nand a comprehensive review of the available evidence. \nTherefore, based on previous studies, the purpose of \nthis study was to conduct a meta-analysis comparing the \nresponses of BFR-RT and HL-RT on muscle strength and \nhypertrophy. To further explore the effects on muscle \nstrength and hypertrophy of these protocols, we will also \nconsider potential influence factors such as population \ncharacteristics (i.e., training status, sex and age), proto -\ncol characteristics (i.e., upper or lower limbs, duration \nand frequency), test specificity (i.e., 1RM and spacing or \nequal speed testing), and region-specific adaptations in \nmuscle mass.\nMethods\nSearch Strategy and Study Selection\nThe articles were identified through the English data -\nbases Web of Knowledge, PubMed, EBSCO-SPORTDis -\ncus from the earliest record up to February 2024, and the \nChinese database WANFANG DATA, CNKI from the \nearliest record up to February 2024. The search strategy \ncombined the English and Chinese terms (see Additional \nfile  1: Table  S1). Two reviewers (GY and ZY) evalu -\nated the titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles to \nassessed their eligibility for the meta-analysis. In cases \n\nPage 3 of 21\nGeng et al. Sports Medicine - Open (2024) 10:58 \n \nof differences, a consensus was adopted. If necessary, \nthe third reviewer (WXP) evaluated the article. If the \nabstract did not provide sufficient information about the \ninclusion criteria, the reviewers read the full text.\nEligibility Criteria\nStudies were considered for inclusion if they met the \nfollowing criteria: (1) articles were published in English \nor Chinese; (2) subjects were healthy people, (3) pre- \nand post-intervention assessment of muscular strength \n(i.e., dynamic, isometric or isokinetic test); (4) pre- and \npost-intervention assessment of muscle hypertrophy \n(i.e., magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomog -\nraphy, or ultrasonography); (5) comparisons between \nHL-RT (i.e., > 65%1RM) and BFR-RT (i.e., < 50%1RM); \n(6) score ≥ 4 on the Physiotherapy Evidence Database \n(PEDro) scale.\nStudy Quality\nThe quality of the study was determined by using the \nPEDro scale, based on the Delphi list [ 30]. Studies with \na score ≥ 4 were included in this meta-analysis (see Addi -\ntional file 1: Table S2). For each of the items (2–11) of the \nPEDro scale, two reviewers (GY and ZY) assessed the \nstudies independently. In cases of disagreement, a con -\nsensus was adopted or a third reviewer (WXP) evaluated \nthe study.\nData Extraction\nAfter screening of the studies, all included studies were \nassessed for eligibility based on their full texts. Two \nreviewers (GY and ZY) extracted data from the articles \nindependently; in cases of disagreement, if no consen -\nsus could be reached, a third reviewer (WXP) was con -\nsulted. The data extracted were recorded relating to (1) \npopulation characteristics (i.e., age, sex and training sta -\ntus); (2) intervention protocol characteristics (i.e., dura -\ntion, frequency, training load, volume, exercises etc.); (3) \npre- and post-intervention assessment of muscle strength \n(i.e., dynamic, isometric, or isokinetic test); (4) pre- and \npost-intervention assessment of muscle hypertrophy \n(cross-sectional area [CSA], muscle thickness and mus -\ncle mass). The trained individuals were defined as ath -\nletes or individuals who participated in regular resistance \ntraining protocols before the intervention. The untrained \nindividuals were defined as individuals who were seden -\ntary or did not participate in regular resistance training \nprotocols before the interventions. In cases of incomplete \ndata availability, we extrapolated the data from figures \nor contacted the corresponding author. The graphical \ndata were extracted using the OriginPro 2021 (Version \n2021. OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA) \ngraphical digitizing tool. Only the last was included as \nthe post-intervention value for analysis, when interven -\ntion effects were assessed at multiple time points. When \nintervention effects were measured through multiple \nmeasurement methods (e.g., CSA and muscle thickness \nfor muscle size), the multiple outcomes were combined \n(i.e., using the mean of the outcomes) [ 31]. The combi -\nnation was performed by Comprehensive Meta-Analysis \nsoftware (version 3.3, Biostat, Inc., Englewood, NJ, USA). \nThe extracted data of included studies are provided in \nTables 1 and 2.\nStatistical Analyses\nAll analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-\nAnalysis software (version 3.3, Biostat, Inc., Englewood, \nNJ, USA). The comparisons (BFR-RT vs. HL-RT) were \ncalculated as the effect size difference (ESdiff) using the \ndifference in pre- and post- intervention mean and stand-\nard deviation values of muscle strength and mass, sam -\nple size and correlation between pre- and post-test for all \ngroups. If the studies included in the meta-analysis did \nnot report correlation between pre- and post-test, the \nfollowing formula was used for estimation [20, 72]:\nwhere Spre and Spost are the standard deviation of pre-test \nand post-test, respectively. SD is the standard deviation \nof difference between pre- and post-test calculated using \nthe following formula [1, 20]:\nUsing the correction factor to correct the small sam -\nple size bias of all ESdiff [20, 31]. The correction factor is \ngiven by:\nThe subjects of the studies included in the present \nmeta-analysis came from different populations. Moreo -\nver, different training protocols and various strength and \nhypertrophy measurements and variables were utilized in \nthese studies. All factors may have an impact on the effect \nof the intervention. Thus, the random-effects model was \nused to perform the meta-analysis [ 73]. The I2 statistics \nwas used to assess heterogeneity. I2 values of 25%, 50% \nand 75% were set as low, moderate and high levels of het-\nerogeneity, respectively. [74].\nThe first step was to compare the effects of BFR-RT \nand HL-RT on muscle strength and muscle mass.

Based \non the average age reported by the included studies, the \nage subgroups were divided into young (≤ 33 year) and \nold (≥ 57 year). Finally, according to the measured posi -\ntion reported by the studies, the results for muscle hyper-\ntrophy were categorized into three subgroups: proximal, \nmiddle and distal, which were < 50%, = 50% and > 50% of \nthe length of the femur or humerus, respectively.\nTo identify the presence of highly influential studies \nthat might bias the analyses, a sensitivity analysis was per-\nformed. The analysis was therefore conducted by remov -\ning one study at a time and then examining its effect on \ncomparisons. If removal changed the significance level \nof ESdiff (i.e., from P ≤ 0.05 to P > 0.05, or vice versa), the \nstudy was considered as influential. This method has \nbeen used elsewhere [75]. The funnel plot, and Begg and \nEgger’s test were used to consider and assess publication \nbias, respectively. All data are presented as mean ± stand-\nard error. The significance level was set at P ≤ 0.05.\nResults\nThe initial search retrieved 2801 English studies and \nChinese 361studies. Afterwards, 723 duplicated studies \nwere excluded. After evaluation of titles and abstracts, \n2376 studies were removed, while the remaining 63 stud -\nies were assessed through full texts. Finally, 53 studies \nwere considered to meet the inclusion criteria (Fig.  1), \n51 of which were included in the muscle strength \nanalysis (Table 1) and 28 in the muscle hypertrophy anal-\nysis (Table 2). In addition, by contacting the authors, the \nmuscle hypertrophy data of one study were obtained [28]. \nHowever, after multiple attempts to contact the author, \nthe muscle strength and hypertrophy data for another \nstudy were not included as the author did not respond \n[76].\nMuscle Strength\nFifty-one studies involving 1164 participants were \nincluded in the present meta-analysis to compare muscle \nstrength gains. In the studies that investigated the trained \npopulation, only one study adopted 9 weeks of training \nduration and one study adopted a training frequency of 5 \nsessions per week (Fig. 2).\nThe overall ESdiff demonstrated significantly lower \ngains in muscle strength for BFR-RT compared with \nHL-RT (ESdiff = − 0.335 ± 0.092, 95% confidence inter -\nval [CI] − 0.515 to − 0.156) (Fig.  2 and Table  3). How -\never, when considering training status, the differences \nbetween trained and untrained subgroups were signifi -\ncant (Q = 29.39, P < 0.01) (Table 3). Significantly higher \nstrength gains for BFR-RT were observed compared \nwith HL-RT in the trained group (ESdiff = 0.491 ± 0.172, \n95% CI 0.154 to 0.827) (Fig.  3 and Table  3). In con -\ntrast, the strength gains of HL-RT were significantly \nhigher than that of BFR-RT in the untrained group \n (ESdiff = − 0.552 ± 0.087, 95%CL − 0.722 to − 0.382) (Fig. 3 \nand Table 3). In trained individuals, there were no signifi-\ncant differences between the different sexes, limbs, dura -\ntions, frequency and test types (Table  3 and Additional \nTable 1 (continued)\nReferences Age Training \nStatus\nN Exercise Protocol Weeks \n(times/\nwk)\nExercise \nload\nOcclusion \npressure\nMuscle \nstrength \nassessment\nHoriuchi et al. \n[67]\n18–30 Untrained M12 LP , KE BFR-RT:4 × 20 4(4) 30%1RM 130%AOP Dynamic LP \n& KE\n18–30 M12 HL-RT:3 × 10 4(4) 75%1RM\nJudd et al.

    "discussion": "The purpose of the current study was to compare the \neffects of BFR-RT and HL-RT on the muscle strength \nand hypertrophy, using HL-RT as a control to evalu -\nate the effects and characteristics of BFR-RT. The main \nfinding of the present study was that training status \nwas an important influencing factor in the effects of \nBFR-RT. The trained individuals will get greater mus -\ncle strength and hypertrophy gains from BFR-RT as \ncompared with HL-RT. However, in the untrained indi -\nviduals, the results demonstrated that superior gains in \nmuscle strength and similar muscle mass for HL-RT as \ncompared with BFR-RT.\nEffect of BFR-RT on Trained Individuals\nThe analysis results of trained individuals (ESdiff = 0.491) \nsuggested that in the comparison of these two training \nmodalities, 69% of trained individuals may obtain greater \ngains in muscle strength with BFR-RT [77].\nTraining is initially characterized by neural adapta -\ntions, however, later as neural adaptations reach a pla -\nteau, muscular adaptation (i.e., hypertrophy) dominates \nFig. 4 Forest plot of the effect size difference between BFR-RT versus HL-RT for muscle hypertrophy.

Sports Medicine - Open (2024) 10:58 \n \n[23, 78]. In intermediate and advanced training, the \nprogress of strength training is limited to the degree of \nmuscle adaptation that can be achieved [23]. Hakkinen \net  al. reported that during one-year traditional strength \ntraining, advanced weight-lifters show limited potential \nfor further neural adaptations, and the total mean mus -\ncle fiber area did not increase significantly [79]. However, \nmounting research indicates that BFR-RT can promote \nmuscle hypertrophy in athletes [18, 26, 43, 80, 81], and \neven in elite powerlifters the muscle fiber CSA increased \nmore with BFR-RT than with HL-RT [26].\nMetabolic stress was believed to be one of the factors \npromoting muscle hypertrophy [82]. Compared with \nother strength training protocols, BFR-RT was believed \nto produce a higher level of metabolic stress [83]. Stud -\nies suggested that compared with normoxic conditions, \nresistance training under the hypoxic condition caused \ngreater metabolic and hormonal responses [84, 85], \nwhereas it was believed that blood flow restriction could \ncause similar muscle hypoxia as compared with systemic \nhypoxia [86]. In this study, the results (Table  4) showed \nthat in the trained individuals, superior muscle hypertro -\nphy gains were observed for BFR-RT as compared with \nHL-RT. Put another way, 76% of the trained population \nmay obtain greater gains in muscle hypertrophy with \nBFR-RT [77]. In fact, our results showed that the average \nrelative strength change [(pre-training − post-training)/\npre-training × 100] with BFR-RT (8.4% ± 1.09) was twice \nthat of HL-RT (3.96% ± 0.66) in the trained individuals.\nEffect of BFR-RT on Untrained Individuals\nBeing different from the trained subjects, the analysis \nresults for untrained individuals (ESdiff = − 0.552) sug -\ngested that about 70% of untrained individuals may expe-\nrience greater gains in muscle strength with HL-RT [77].\nHowever, previous studies have found that the muscle \nactivation level of BFR-RT was higher than that of the \nsame intensity (low load) resistance exercise [87–90], \nFig. 5 Forest plot of the effect size difference between BFR-RT versus HL-RT for muscle hypertrophy according to training status.

Sports Medicine - Open (2024) 10:58 \nits muscle activation level is still low as compared with \nHL-RT [91–93]. For example, Cook et  al. [92] reported \nthat muscle activation level (according to surface elec -\ntromyography) was greater in the HL-RT at the begin -\nning and end of exercise compared with the BFR-RT. It \nhas been suggested that increasing the occlusion pres -\nsure (from 40 to 60% occlusive pressure) could increase \nthe activation level of muscle [94], but recent research \nshowed that even with higher occlusive pressure (80%), \nthe activation level of BFR-RT on muscle was also signifi-\ncantly lower than HL-RT [91]. While these findings were \nbased on surface electromyography, BFR-RT may not \nachieve the same level of muscle activation and produce \nthe same neural stimulation as HL-RT [83, 95].\nLimitations\nThe current meta-analysis has some limitations. The lack \nof studies including females limited generalizability of \nthe findings. Because of the sparse number of studies, the \nresults comparing muscle hypertrophy in trained indi -\nviduals should be interpreted with caution. In addition, \nthe data from one study were not included [76]. However, \nthe sensitivity analysis revealed that no single study had a \nsignificant impact on the analysis results. Therefore, the \nabsence of these data would unlikely to have affected the \ncurrent results and their interpretation.\nConclusion\nThe present meta-analysis indicates that training status \nis an important factor influencing the effects of BFR-\nRT. Compared to HL-RT, trained individuals can obtain \ngreater strength and hypertrophy gains from BFR-RT. \nHowever, in untrained individuals, the results demon -\nstrate that superior muscle strength and similar mass \ngains for HL-RT.\nFrom a practical standpoint, BFR-RT could be a ben -\neficial supplemental training protocol for trained popula -\ntion. It has been demonstrated that the combination of \nBFR- and HL-RT was more beneficial for the increase of \nmuscle strength [97]. Thus, healthy individuals or ath -\nletes are likely to maximize their training adaptations by \ncombining these two training methods [4, 98]. Finally, \nit is important to highlight that BFR-RT remains a valid \nand effective alternative for people who cannot perform \nhigh-load resistance training.\nAbbreviations\n1RM One repetition maximum\nBFR-RT Low-load resistance training (< 50% 1RM) combined with blood \nflow restriction\nCI Confidence interval\nCSA Cross-sectional area\nESdiff Effect size difference\nHL-RT High-load resistance training\nPEDro Physiotherapy Evidence Database\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. \norg/ 10. 1186/ s40798- 024- 00719-3.\nAdditional file 1 \nAcknowledgements\nNot applicable.\nAuthor contributions\nYG and XPW contributed to the study concept and design.
