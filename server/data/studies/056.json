    "conclusions": "— An energy-restricted HP diet combined with RT achieved greater weight\nloss and more favorable changes in body composition. All treatments had similar improvements\nin glycemic control and CVD risk markers.\nDiabetes Care33:969–976, 2010\nC\naloric restriction and physical activ-\nity are cornerstones of obesity and\ntype 2 diabetes management (1).\nThe substitution of some dietary carbohy-\ndrate for protein in a low-fat (/H1102130% total\nenergy) diet may improve body composi-\ntion and cardiovascular disease (CVD)\nrisk factors including insulin sensitivity,\nglycemic control, and blood lipids in\noverweight/obese populations, including\npatients with type 2 diabetes (2–5). How-\never, these studies have almost invariably\nassessed modiﬁed macronutrient compo-\nsitions without the inclusion of any exer-\ncise intervention.\nLayman et al. (6) showed additive ef-\nfects of a high-protein (HP) diet com-\nbined with exercise for improving body\ncomposition in healthy overweight/obese\nwomen with greater weight and fat loss\nfollowing a lifestyle intervention of exer-\ncise plus an HP diet, compared with HP\ndiet alone or a standard carbohydrate\n(CON) diet with or without exercise. A\nstudy by Meckling et al. (7) showed sim-\nilar effects. In both these studies, the ex-\nercise programs used were primarily\naerobic exercise based, whereas resistance\nexercise training (RT) may be more efﬁca-\ncious (8). During weight loss, RT can\nmaintain and/or increase lean tissue and\nimprove physical functioning (8), and its\nimportance for improving glycemic con-\ntrol in patients with type 2 diabetes is well\nestablished (9). Recently, Kerksick et al.\n(10) showed greater improvements in\nbody composition in obese women fol-\nlowing a 14-week RT program when car-\nbohydrate was substituted with protein.\nThis suggests that an HP diet combined\nwith RT may improve weight loss, body\ncomposition, and cardiometabolic risk\nfactors. However, despite its importance,\nno studies have evaluated these effects in\nindividuals with type 2 diabetes. This\nstudy compared the effects of an energy-\nrestricted HP diet and an isocaloric “tradi-\ntional” CON diet with and without RT on\nweight loss, body composition, CVD risk\nfactors, and glycemic control in patients\nwith type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that\nHP/H11001RT treatment would produce the\ngreatest improvements on these outcomes.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND\nMETHODS — A total of 83 over-\nweight/obese sedentary men and women\n(BMI 35.3 /H110064.5 kg/m\n2; aged 55.0 /H110068.4\nyears) with type 2 diabetes were recruited\nby public advertisement (Fig. 1).

Participants\nprovided written informed consent.\nThe study was approved by the human\nresearch ethics committees of the Com-\nmonwealth Scientiﬁc and Industrial Re-\nsearch Organisation (CSIRO) and the\nUniversity of Adelaide.\nIn a parallel study, participants were\nblocked matched for age, sex, and weight,\nthen randomized to one of four lifestyle\ninterventions: an energy-restricted stan-\ndard carbohydrate, low-protein, low-fat\ndiet alone (CON) or with RT (CON/H11001RT);\nor an isocaloric higher-protein, moder-\nate-carbohydrate, low-fat diet alone (HP)\nor with RT (HP /H11001RT) for 16 weeks. At\nbaseline (week 0) and week 16, partici-\npants attended the CSIRO research clinic\nafter an overnight fast for assessment. At\nthe clinic testing visits, height (week 0\nonly), body weight, blood pressure, waist\ncircumference (WC), and body composi-\ntion were measured before a venous\nblood sample was drawn and muscle\nstrength was assessed. Prior to the clinical\nassessments, a 24-h urine sample was\ncollected.\nMedications at baseline and changes\nthroughout the study were documented.\nLipid-lowering and antihypertensive\nmedications were encouraged to remain\nconstant throughout the intervention.\nParticipants were asked not to modify\ntheir lifestyle patterns other than neces-\nsary during the intervention to comply\nwith the study protocol.\nDiet interventions\nThe diets were designed to be isocaloric\nwith moderate energy restriction\n(/H110116,000 kJ/day for women, /H110117,000 kJ/\nday for men). The planned macronutrient\nproﬁle of the CON diet was 53% of total\nenergy as carbohydrate, 19% ( /H110110.7 g /H18528\nkg\n/H110021 /H18528day/H110021) protein, and 26% fat. The\ntarget proﬁle for the HP diet was 43% car-\nbohydrate, 33% (/H110111.2 g /H18528kg/H110021 /H18528day/H110021)\nprotein, and 22% fat. To facilitate dietary\ncompliance, detailed dietary advice, meal\nplanning, and recipe information were\nprovided at baseline and every 2 weeks by\na qualiﬁed dietitian. Key foods represen-\ntative of each diet’s macronutrient proﬁle\n(/H1101150% total energy) were supplied every\n2 weeks. Diets were structured to include\nspeciﬁc food quantities/weights to ensure\ncorrect macronutrient and energy proﬁle\nwere achieved. These foods were listed in\na quantitative food record completed\ndaily by participants. Participants were\nasked to weigh and measure their food\nusing scales provided. Dietary composi-\ntion was assessed by a qualiﬁed dietitian\nbased on the analysis of 7 consecutive\ndays from the semiquantitative food\nrecord of each 2-week period using a\ncomputerized database (Foodworks Pro-\nfessional Edition, version 4, 1998; Xyris\nSoftware, Highgate Hill, Australia). Par-\nticipants who did not complete the food\nrecords were excluded as noncompliers.\nFigure 1— Participant ﬂow.\nDiet composition, exercise, and type 2 diabetes\n970 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 33, NUMBER 5, MAY 2010 care.diabetesjournals.org\nDownloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/33/5/969/606092/zdc00510000969.pdf by guest on 04 December 2025\n\n\nExercise intervention\nThe CON/H11001RT and HP/H11001RT group partic-\nipants followed a progressive RT pro-\ngram. Eight separate exercises (leg press,\nknee extension, chest press, shoulder\npress, lat pull down, seated row, triceps\npress, and sit-ups) were performed using\nweight-stacked machines (Maxim Health\nFitness, Adelaide, Australia), except sit-\nups, on 3 nonconsecutive days/week. The\nweight loading was set at 70–85% one\nrepetition maximum (1RM, protocol de-\nscribed below), determined for each exer-\ncise at Week 0. This allowed/H110118–12 reps\nto volitional fatigue with two sets per ex-\nercise and 1–2 min rest between sets to be\nperformed. Once participants could suc-\ncessfully perform two sets of /H1102212 repeti-\ntions, the weight load was increased to\nmaintain the training load. Resistance ex-\nercise training sessions lasted /H1101145 min\nand were conducted at the CSIRO gym-\nnasium under professional supervision.\nParticipants completed a training diary,\nand if a scheduled session was missed,\nthey were encouraged to attend a make-\nup session as soon as possible.\nOutcomes, body weight,\ncomposition, blood pressure, and\nmuscle strength\nBody mass was measured using calibrated\nelectronic digital scales (Mercury; AMZ\n14, Tokyo, Japan), and body composition\nwas measured using dual-energy X-ray\nabsorptiometry (DXA; Lunar Prodigy;\nGeneral Electric, Madison, WI) to assess\ntotal body fat mass and total body fat-free\nmass (FFM). WC was measured on a hor-\nizontal plane 2 cm proximal to the upper-\nmost lateral border of the right iliac crest.\nSeated blood pressure was measured us-\ning an automated sphygmomanometer\n(DYNAMAP 8100; Criticon, Tampa, FL).\nMuscle strength (1RM) was assessed\npre- and postintervention for chest press\nand lat pull down according to standard\nguidelines (11). 1RM of the other ﬁve\nweight-stacked exercises were also as-\nsessed in the participants in the exercise\ngroups at baseline only to set initial train-\ning loads. To determine 1RM, following a\nlow-intensity warm-up, participants per-\nformed four to ﬁve trials (separated by a\n2-min resting interval) using varying\nmoderate-heavy weights to determine the\nhighest weight that could be lifted with\nonly one repetition through the full range\nof motion with correct technique.\nBiochemical analyses\nSerum lipids and insulin, plasma glucose,\nC-reactive protein (CRP), and creatinine\nwere measured using standard methods\n(12). A1C, measured using high-\nperformance liquid chromatography, and\n24-h urinary urea, creatinine, and albu-\nmin were assessed at a commercial labo-\nratory (IMVS, Adelaide, Australia).\nCreatinine clearance was calculated as\n(urine creatinine [ /H9262mol/l] /H11003urine vol-\nume [ml])/(plasma creatinine [/H9262mol/l] /H11003\nminutes) and corrected for body surface\narea (13).\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using\nSPSS for Windows (version 17.0; SPSS,\nChicago, IL). Prior to hypothesis testing,\ndata were examined for normality. Non–\nnormally distributed variables (insulin,\nCRP, and urinary albumin) were logarith-\nmically transformed before analysis. Dif-\nferences in baseline characteristics were\ncompared by one-way ANOVA for con-\ntinuous variables and /H9273\n2 tests for cat-\negorical variables. This investigation rep-\nresents an efﬁcacy trial to determine the\nphysiological/metabolic effects of the\ntreatments. Primary analysis was con-\nducted on participants who completed\nthe study per protocol. Secondary inten-\ntion-to-treat (ITT) analysis was also con-\nducted for the primary outcome measures\n(body weight and composition, cardio-\nmetabolic and glycemic control), in-\ncluding participants who completed the\nstudy irrespective to protocol adher-\nence. Changes over time in the groups\nwere assessed using repeated-measures\nANOVA. The effects of the treatments\non changes were assessed using one-\nway ANOVA, with group (CON, HP,\nCON/H11001RT, and HP /H11001RT) as a between-\nsubject factor. Where there was a signiﬁ-\ncant main effect, post hoc tests with\nDunnett adjustment for multiple compar-\nisons were performed to determine differ-\nences between group means compared\nwith HP/H11001RT; based on a prior hypothe-\nsis, the HP /H11001RT group would achieve\ngreater changes compared with the other\ntreatments. Age and sex were included as\ncovariates. No signiﬁcant effect of sex or\nage was observed for any of the outcomes.\nTo compare the magnitude of change be-\ntween the two diets (CON and CON/H11001RT\nversus HP and HP/H11001RT) and exercise ver-\nsus nonexercise (CON and HP versus\nCON/H11001RT and HP /H11001RT), planned con-\ntrasts were used in the statistical model.\nPearson correlation coefﬁcients were used\nto determine the relationships between\nvariables. Statistical signiﬁcance was set at\nP /H110210.05. Data are means /H11006SD.\nRESULTS\nParticipants\nOf 83 randomized participants, 18 with-\ndrew and 6 participants were excluded for\ndietary noncompliance (failure to com-\nplete food records); 59 participants com-\npleted the study per protocol (Fig. 1).\nThere was no difference between treat-\nment groups, diets, or exercise versus\nnonexercise groups in the number of par-\nticipants who withdrew ( P /H113500.34) or\nwho were excluded (P /H113500.17). At base-\nline, there were no signiﬁcant differences\nin age, weight, BMI, A1C, and sex distri-\nbution between groups (P /H113500.12). These\ncharacteristics were also similar between\nparticipants who completed or did not\ncomplete the study (P /H113500.09), except for\nage in which completers were on average\n5 years younger (completers: aged 50.8/H11006\n10.4 years, dropouts: aged 56.1 /H110067.4\nyears; P /H110050.02).\nDietary composition and exercise\ncompliance\nBased on the food records, participants\nshowed good compliance with the pre-\nscribed diets (Table 1). Total energy in-\ntake was similar across treatment groups,\nwhile macronutrient composition was\ndifferent between the diet groups; the HP\nand HP /H11001RT groups consumed signiﬁ-\ncantly more protein and less carbohydrate\nand fat compared with the CON and\nCON/H11001RT groups. There was a signiﬁcant\ndiet effect for the urinary urea–to–\ncreatinine excretion ratio ( P /H110050.003),\nwhich decreased in the CON diet groups\n(CON: 30.8 /H110068.6 to 26.7 /H110063.8,\nCON/H11001RT: 25.9/H110065.1 to 24.2/H110064.0) and\nincreased in the HP diet groups (HP:\n31.1 /H110069.8 to 33.6 /H1100611.2, HP /H11001RT:\n28.3 /H110069.5 to 31.5 /H110067.7), indicating\nhigher protein intakes in the HP diet\ngroups.\nCompliance with RT was deﬁned as\nthe number of exercise sessions com-\npleted at the prescribed training loads per\ntotal number of prescribed sessions. All\nparticipants in the CON/H11001RT and HP/H11001RT\ngroups achieved compliance with the pre-\nscription (deﬁned as 75% of prescribed\nsessions), on average completing 93%\n(43.5 /H110064.0 of 47) of the prescribed ses-\nsions. There was a signiﬁcant effect of ex-\nercise treatment for 1RM lat pull down\nand chest press (P /H110210.001) such that in-\nWycherley and Associates\ncare.diabetesjournals.org D IABETES CARE, VOLUME 33, NUMBER 5, MAY 2010 971\nDownloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/33/5/969/606092/zdc00510000969.pdf by guest on 04 December 2025\n\n\ncreases occurred in the diet /H11001RT groups,\nwith no change in the diet-only groups\n(Table 2), indicating compliance with the\nprescribed RT.\nBody weight and composition\nOverall, body weight was reduced ( P /H11021\n0.001), with a signiﬁcant group effect\n(P /H110050.04), such that HP /H11001RT achieved\ngreatest weight loss (CON: /H110028.9%, HP:\n/H110028.7%, CON /H11001RT: /H1100210.0%, HP /H11001RT:\n/H1100212.7%) (Table 2). Post hoc analysis\nshowed that the greater weight loss in\nHP/H11001RT was statistically signiﬁcant com-\npared with CON and HP groups ( P /H11021\n0.05), but compared with CON/H11001RT sta-\ntistical signiﬁcance was not reached (P /H11005\n0.20). Overall, weight loss was not differ-\nent between the two diets ( P /H110050.18);\nhowever, the exercise groups (HP /H11001RT\nand CON /H11001RT) lost more weight com-\npared with the diet-only groups (CON\nand HP) (diet/H11001RT: /H1100212.0 /H110065.7 kg, diet\nonly: /H110028.8 /H110064.6 kg;P /H110050.02). ITT anal-\nysis showed a similar weight loss pattern,\nalbeit the magnitude of effect was reduced\n(CON: /H110029.4 /H110066.5 kg, HP: /H110028.0 /H110064.8\nkg, CON/H11001RT: /H1100210.5 /H110065.1 kg, HP/H11001RT:\n/H1100212.6 /H110066.5 kg; P /H110050.16 group effect).\nSimilarly, fat mass and WC reduced\nin all groups (P /H110210.001) (Table 2), with a\nsigniﬁcant group effect (P /H113490.006) such\nthat HP/H11001RT had greatest reductions. Post\nhoc analysis showed that HP/H11001RT had sig-\nniﬁcantly greater reductions compared\nwith CON and HP (P /H113490.02), but com-\npared with CON /H11001RT, statistical signiﬁ-\ncance was not reached (fat mass: P /H11005\n0.06, WC: P /H110050.32). Overall, compared\nwith the diet-only groups, the exercising\ngroups had greater reductions in fat mass\n(diet/H11001RT: /H110029.6 /H110064.1 kg, diet only:\n/H110026.7 /H110063.8 kg; P /H110210.01) and WC\n(diet/H11001RT: /H1100212.4 /H110064.7 cm, diet only:\n/H110028.5 /H110064.3 cm; P /H110210.01). Overall, more\nfat mass loss occurred in participants con-\nsuming the HP diet (/H110029.4 /H110064.5 kg) com-\npared with the CON diet (7.3 /H110063.8 kg;\nP /H110050.06). There was an overall reduction\nin FFM (Table 2), with no effect of treat-\nment group (P /H110050.91), diet composition\n(P /H110050.80), or exercise participation (P /H11005\n0.51). ITT analysis conﬁrmed these re-\nsults, with a signiﬁcant group effect evi-\ndent for fat mass and WC (P /H113490.02) but\nnot for FFM (P /H110050.75).\nCardiometabolic outcomes and\nglycemic control\nOverall, blood pressure, lipids, glucose,\nA1C, and CRP were reduced ( P /H113490.02)\n(Table 2) with no difference between\ntreatment groups (P /H113500.37), diet compo-\nsition (P /H113500.27), or exercise participa-\ntion ( P /H113500.21). Insulin concentrations\nalso decreased (P /H110210.001) with a differ-\nential (nonsigniﬁcant) effect evident be-\ntween treatment groups (P /H110050.11), such\nthat HP/H11001RT experienced approximately\ntwofold greater reductions compared\nwith the other groups. No differential in-\nsulin response between diet compositions\n(P /H110050.19) or exercise participation (P /H11005\n0.29) were observed. Changes in insulin\nwere signiﬁcantly correlated with changes\nin weight ( r /H110050.35, P /H110210.01) and fat\nmass (r /H110050.36, P /H110050.005). ITT analysis\nalso showed no signiﬁcant differences in\nthe changes of these parameters between\nthe groups.\nCreatinine clearance and urinary\nalbumin\nOverall, creatinine clearance was reduced\n(P /H110210.001) (Table 2), with no differential\neffect between treatments (P /H110050.68), diet\ncomposition (P /H110050.55), or exercise par-\nticipation (P /H110050.46). At week 0, 45 par-\nticipants (CON diet: 27, HP diet: 18) had\nnormoalbuminuria (urinary albumin ex-\ncretion /H1102120 /H9262g/min), and values re-\nmained in the normoalbuminuria range at\nweek 16, except in 1 participant in the\nCON group whose urinary albumin ex-\ncretion increased (33.4 /H9262g/min) to mi-\ncroalbuminuria classiﬁcation (urinary\nalbumin excretion 20–200 /H9262g/min). At\nbaseline, 14 participants (24%; CON diet:\nn /H110056, HP diet:n /H110058) had microalbumin-\nuria; at week 16, 4 participants (CON:\nn /H110052, HP: n /H110052) remained in the mi-\ncroalbuminuria range and 10 participants\ndecreased to normoalbuminuria classiﬁ-\ncation (CON: n /H110054, HP: n /H110056).\nMedication changes\nA total of 33 participants were on hypo-\nglycemic medication at baseline (CON:\nn /H1100511, HP: n /H110057, CON/H11001RT: n /H1100510,\nHP/H11001RT: n /H110055), and during the interven-\ntion, medication dose was reduced in 9\nparticipants (CON: n /H110052, HP: n /H110051,\nCON/H11001RT: n /H110054, HP/H11001RT: n /H110052) and\nincreased in 1 participant in the HP\ngroup.

energy-restricted diet that\noccurred independent of macronutrient\ncomposition or participation in a RT\nprogram in sedentary obese patients\nwith type 2 diabetes. The addition of RT\nincreased weight and fat mass loss,\nwhich was further magniﬁed by replac-\ning some dietary carbohydrate with\nprotein.\nThe HP/H11001RT group exhibited at least a\n3.3-kg greater weight and fat loss and\n21% greater reduction in WC compared\nwith the other treatment groups. Previous\nstudies in healthy, overweight/obese indi-\nviduals without type 2 diabetes show\ngreater reductions in weight and fat mass\nof similar magnitude when exercise train-\ning is combined with a hypocaloric HP\ndiet compared with an isocaloric CON\ndiet (6,7). The CON diet was designed to\nreﬂect standard dietary recommendations\n(15–20% of total energy as protein) (1).\nThe HP diet was designed to achieve pro-\ntein intake of /H1102225%, corresponding with\ntypically prescribed HP diets; it provided\nan average protein intake of 1.12 g/H18528kg\n/H110021 /H18528\nday/H110021. Previous studies show that an HP\ndiet compared with a CON diet is associ-\nated with greater reductions in fat mass\n(5,6). RT also reduces fat mass in obese\nindividuals, independent of caloric re-\nstriction (14), suggesting that the separate\ninterventional components of an HP diet\nand RT may have contributed to the\ngreater weight and fat mass losses follow-\ning the HP/H11001RT treatment.\nAlthough a signiﬁcant main group ef-\nfect was observed, post hoc analysis\nshowed that greater weight, fat mass, and\nWC reductions in the HP/H11001RT group only\nreached statistical signiﬁcance compared\nwith the CON and HP groups but not the\nCON/H11001RT group (P /H113500.06), despite large\nabsolute differences. Nevertheless, the\nadditional weight and fat losses that oc-\ncurred when RT was combined with an\nHP diet compared with a CON diet rep-\nresent moderate to large effect sizes\n(0.67–0.85) and are considered clinically\nrelevant and shown to produce important\nhealth outcomes (15).

Power analysis estimates that a\nsample size of 24 subjects per group\nwould have been needed for the observed\n3.3-kg weight loss difference between the\ngroups to have been statistically signiﬁ-\ncant (80%,P /H110050.05). Further larger stud-\nies are required to conﬁrm these ﬁndings.\nIn contrast, Layman et al. (6), who ob-\nserved similar absolute weight and fat loss\ndifferences between treatment groups\ncomparing CON and HP diets with and\nwithout exercise, achieved statistically\nsigniﬁcant diet and exercise effects with\nsmaller sample sizes (n /H1100512 per group).\nHowever, this study only examined\nwomen, and sex differences in body com-\nposition responses to dieting have been\npreviously observed (5). Although no sex\neffects were observed in our study, inclu-\nsion of men and women may have in-\ncreased the data variability, subsequently\nlowering the statistical power.\nMechanisms underlying the greater\nweight and fat changes in HP/H11001RT are not\nclear. Given that both diets were isoca-\nloric and participants undertook the same\nRT program under controlled conditions,\nit suggests these changes reﬂect metabolic\ndifferences. The HP /H11001RT group experi-\nenced approximately twofold greater re-\nductions in fasting insulin compared with\nthe other treatments, although, again,\npower was not sufﬁcient to reveal signiﬁ-\ncant differences. Nevertheless, there was a\nsigniﬁcant correlation between the\nchanges in weight and fat mass and insu-\nlin levels. Insulin has fat-sparing effects\nand promotes adipose tissue accumula-\ntion (17). Hence, greater insulin reduc-\ntions in the HP /H11001RT group may explain\nthe greater fat mass reductions; however,\ncausation cannot be determined. Other\nevidence suggests that fat mass accumu-\nlation drives insulin resistance (17). Alter-\nnately, fat has more positive effects on\nenergy balance compared with other ma-\ncronutrients (18). Therefore, although\nunlikely, the possibility that lower fat in-\ntakes in the HP diet contributed greater\nfat reductions in the HP /H11001exercise group\ncannot be dismissed.\nIn the exercising groups, high com-\npliance with the RT program achieved\nsubstantial strength gains, which is asso-\nciated with metabolic disease reductions\n(19). Nevertheless, FFM reduced simi-\nlarly across treatment groups. Although\nprevious studies have observed protective\neffects of RT (20) and HP diets (3) on FFM\nduring caloric restriction, these effects\nhave not been consistently shown (5), and\nperhaps even higher relative protein in-\ntakes are required. Compared with this\nstudy, experiments demonstrating FFM\npreservation following a hypocaloric HP\ndiet with RT (6,21) administered higher\nrelative protein intakes (1.12 vs. /H113501.4 g /H18528\nkg\n/H110021 /H18528day/H110021). A meta-analysis showed\nthat the degree of FFM retention during\nweight loss increases with increasing\nquartiles of protein intake (2), suggesting\nthat relative protein intakes may be an im-\nportant weight loss program design\nconsideration.\nSubstantial reductions in CVD risk\nmarkers and glycemic control occurred\nduring the intervention with no observ-\nable differences between the groups. Pre-\nvious studies report that RT (14) and HP\ndiets (22) improve A1C independent of\nweight loss in type 2 diabetic patients.\nThe lack of any difference in glycemic\ncontrol between the treatment groups in\nthe present study may therefore be due to\nthe hypoglycemic effects of energy restric-\ntion (23), masking any potential effects of\nexercise or diet composition. Under\nmilder energy restriction, RT has been\nshown to provide additional reductions in\nA1C (9). Longer-term studies are re-\nquired to separate out these effects. Nev-\nertheless, the overall A1C reductions\nobserved is clinically relevant and associ-\nated with a 21% reduction in diabetes-\nrelated mortality (24).\nHP diets having potentially adverse\neffects on renal function remains a con-\ncern (25). However, no differences in\ncreatinine clearance or presence of mi-\ncroalbuminuria between the diets groups\nwere observed. Other short-term, inter-\nventional studies also report no differ-\nences in renal function in obese\nindividuals with type 2 diabetes following\neither an HP or low-protein diet (5,22).\nThis suggests that a hypocaloric HP diet\ndoes not adversely affect renal function, at\nleast over the short term, in subjects with-\nout overt renal impairment. Nevertheless,\ndiabetes is associated with impaired renal\nfunction, and the longer-term effects in\nthis patient population warrants further\ninvestigation.\nAlthough not statistically signiﬁcant,\nhigher participant withdrawals/exclusions\nin the HP diet groups are noteworthy. The\nexact reason/s are not entirely clear, but\nthis is not consistent with previous stud-\nies comparing HP versus CON diets that\nreport similar dropouts with both dietary\ntreatments and in some studies lower\ndropouts following the HP diet (5,7).\nIn",
    "conclusion": ", participation in RT\nproduced greater weight and fat loss and\nincreases in muscular strength compared\nwith energy restriction alone. Addition-\nally, replacement of some carbohydrate\nfor protein further magniﬁed these ef-\nfects, resulting in greatest reductions in\nweight, fat mass, WC, and insulin. All\ntreatments had similar improvements in\nglycemic control and CVD risk. A lifestyle\nmodiﬁcation program combining an en-\nergy-restricted HP diet and RT appears to\nbe a preferred treatment strategy in over-\nweight/obese individuals with type 2 dia-\nbetes. Further studies should evaluate the\nlonger-term effects.\nAcknowledgments— This work was sup-\nported with project grants from the National\nHeart Foundation of Australia, the Diabetes\nAustralia Research Trust, and the Pork Coop-\nerative Research Centre.
