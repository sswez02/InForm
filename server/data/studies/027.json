    "introduction": "The strength-endurance continuum hypothesis dictates that\nincreases in muscle strength and mass are dependent upon\nproper resistance training (RT) load manipulation [ 1].\nAccordingly, for many years high-load RT (HL-RT;\ni.e., [ 65% of one-repetition maximum [1RM]) has been\nindicated to maximize both functional (i.e., strength) and\nmorphological (i.e., hypertrophy) adaptations [ 2–5]. How-\never, recent evidence has shown otherwise. Speciﬁcally,\nlow-load resistance training (20–50% 1RM) associated\nwith blood-ﬂow restriction (BFR-RT) has been demon-\nstrated to be effective in promoting increases in muscle\nstrength and mass in different populations, from athletes to\nseverely diseased individuals [ 6–9].\nRecently, a meta-analysis demonstrated the superiority\nof BFR-RT when compared with an equivalent low-load\nRT without blood ﬂow restriction on gains in muscle\nstrength and mass [ 10]. Although relevant, it seems\nimperative to understand the effects of BFR- as compared\nto HL-RT, an allegedly ‘‘gold standard’’ protocol to\nincrease muscle strength and mass. In this regard, the lit-\nerature is controversial regarding the magnitude of these\nadaptations across protocols. For instance, while some\nstudies have suggested greater increases in muscle strength\nfor HL- as compared with BFR-RT [ 7, 11–14], others have\ndemonstrated similar gains between training protocols\n[15–19]. With respect to muscle mass accrual, results are\nsomewhat more consistent, pointing toward similar effects\nbetween HL- and BFR-RT [ 6, 7, 11, 13, 16–20].\nCurrent literature allows the speculation that discrep-\nancies between studies may be, at least partially, explained\nby differences in testing procedures. Testing speciﬁcity\nmay affect the results, as dynamic muscle strength\nassessment via a 1RM test may undermine the potential of\nBFR-RT. In short, HL-RT implies exercising with heavy\nloads, which are similar to a 1RM test, whereas during\nBFR-RT subjects are never exposed to high loads [ 21].\nTherefore, it has been suggested that nonspeciﬁc strength\nassessment, such as in isometric or isokinetic testing, may\nmore precisely reﬂect the response to different training\nprotocols [ 21]. Dissonant ﬁndings may also be attributed to\ndifferences in BFR-RT characteristics, such as absolute\nocclusion pressure, cuff width and prescription method\n(i.e., individualized or not) between studies. In this regard,\nhigher occlusion pressures may be related to greater muscle\nactivation [ 22], which could theoretically lead to greater\nlong-term adaptations. Importantly, occlusion pressure is\nheavily affected by cuff width, as wider cuffs require lower\nabsolute pressures to similarly reduce blood ﬂow as com-\npared with narrow ones [ 23]. Also, it has been suggested\nthat individualized occlusion pressure determination may\nbe a more appropriate approach in BFR-RT, preventing\nunder- or overestimation of occlusion pressure, and thus\nallowing a more accurate exercise prescription when\ncompared to generalized and non-individualized protocols\n[24]. Finally, differences may also be related to the small\nsamples within each study, which could increase the\nchance for a type II error, warranting a meta-analytic\napproach.\nThus, the aim of the present article was to perform a\nsystematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of HL-\nversus BFR-RT on muscle strength and mass adaptations.\nA secondary purpose was to explore the muscle strength\nand hypertrophy responses between these protocols taking\ninto account potential moderators such as test speciﬁcity\n(i.e., dynamic 1RM and isometric or isokinetic test),\nabsolute occlusion pressure, cuff width, and occlusion\npressure prescription method.\n2 Methods\n2.1 Search Strategy and Study Selection\nThe articles were identiﬁed through the databases PubMed\nand ISI Web of Knowledge from the earliest record up to\nJanuary 2017. The search strategy combined the terms\n‘‘Kaatsu training’’, ‘‘practical Kaatsu training’’, ‘‘practical\nblood ﬂow restriction training’’, ‘‘practical blood ﬂow\nstrength training’’, ‘‘blood ﬂow restriction training’’ ‘‘re-\nsistance training associated with blood ﬂow restriction’’,\n‘‘strength training associated with blood ﬂow restriction’’,\n‘‘low-load resistance training associated with blood ﬂow\nrestriction’’, ‘‘low-intensity associated with blood ﬂow\nrestriction’’, ‘‘muscle strength’’, ‘‘muscle force’’, ‘‘hyper-\ntrophic response’’, ‘‘hypertrophy’’, and ‘‘muscle mass’’.\nTitles and abstracts for the retrieved articles were evaluated\nby two reviewers (ML and RB) to assess their eligibility for\nthe meta-analysis. In case of disagreements, a consensus\nwas adopted or, if necessary, a third reviewer evaluated the\narticle (FCV). If the abstract did not provide sufﬁcient\ninformation regarding the inclusion criteria, the reviewers\nread the full text.\n2.2 Eligibility Criteria\nArticles were eligible for inclusion if they met the fol-\nlowing criteria: (a) pre- and post-training assessment of\nmuscular strength (i.e., dynamic, isometric, or isokinetic\ntest); (b) pre- and post-training assessment of muscle\nhypertrophy (i.e., magnetic resonance imaging, computer-\nized tomography, or ultrasonography); (c) compared HL-\nRT (i.e., [65% 1RM) vs. BFR-RT (i.e., \\50% 1RM);\n(d) score C 4 on the Physiotherapy Evidence Database\nM. E. Lixandra˜o et al.\n123\n\n\n(PEDro) scale; (e) means and standard deviations (or\nstandard errors) were reported from absolute values or\nallow estimation from graphs. If this last criterion was not\nmet, data were directly requested from the authors.\n2.3 Study Quality\nThe study quality was assessed with the PEDro scale, based\non the list of Delphi [ 25]. The scale is composed of 11\nquestions of which only 10 can be scored. The non-rated\nquestion inﬂuences external validity, but not the internal or\nstatistical validity of the trial. To be included in the present\nmeta-analysis, the study must have met at least 4 points on\nthe PEDro scale (see Electronic Supplementary Material\n(ESM), Table S1). Two reviewers (ML and RB) scored the\nstudies according to the proposed scale. In case of dis-\nagreements, a consensus was adopted or, if necessary, a\nthird reviewer evaluated the article (FCV).\n2.4 Data Extraction\nTwo reviewers (ML and RB) separately and independently\nevaluated all articles and extracted data. Relevant data\nregarding participant characteristics (i.e., age and sex),\nstudy characteristics (i.e., training frequency, exercise, sets,\nrepetitions, exercise load, absolute occlusion pressure,\nocclusion pressure prescription, cuff type and intervention\nperiod), muscular strength testing (i.e., dynamic, isometric,\nand isokinetic) and muscle mass (magnetic resonance\nimaging or ultrasound) were extracted. Importantly, when\nmultiple time points for muscle strength and muscle mass\nwere assessed, the latter/last time point available was\nconsidered as the post-training value for analysis. In order\nto assess potential coder drift, two reviewers (ML and RB)\nindependently recorded 100% of the articles. Afterwards,\nall of the studies were cross-checked to conﬁrm accuracy.\nIn case of disagreement, a consensus was adopted or, if\nnecessary, was solved by a third researcher (FCV). Data\nextracted are available in Tables 1 and 2.\n2.5 Statistical Analyses\nAll analyses were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-\nanalysis version 2.2 software (Biostat Inc., Englewwod, NJ,\nUSA). Between-group comparisons (HL- vs. BFR-RT)\nwere calculated as the effect size difference (ES\ndiff) using\npre- and post-intervention (muscle strength and mass), pre-\nintervention standard deviation, sample size and pre- to\npost-correlation for each group. Provided that none of the\nstudies included in the meta-analysis presented pre- to\npost-correlation, this was estimated with the following\nformula: r ¼ S\n2\npre þ S2\npost/C0 S2\nD\n/C16/C17\n=2 /C2 Spre /C2 Spost\n/C0/C1\n. S is the\nstandard deviation, and SD is the standard deviation of the\ndifference score (pre- to post-intervention), deﬁned by:\nSD = root square S2\npre=n\n/C16/C17\nþ S2\npost=n\n/C16/C17hi\n.A l lE S diff were\ncorrected for small sample size bias with the following\nformula: [1 - (3/(4 9 (n1 ? n2 - 2) - 1)]. Heterogene-\nity for between-study variability was veriﬁed with the I 2\nstatistics, with thresholds set as I2 = 25% (low), I2 = 50%\n(moderate), and I2 = 75% (high) [ 26]. Based on the\nresults, data were then analyzed using ﬁxed-effect models.\nDespite the low between-study heterogeneity, the present\nmeta-analysis further explored potential moderators that\ncould inﬂuence the results, expanding the knowledge on\nwhether BFR characteristics could affect training\nresponses.\nThe ﬁrst analysis compared the effects of HL-and BFR-\nRT on muscle strength and mass response. Subsequently, a\nsubgroup analysis was performed to investigate the effects\nof test speciﬁcity (speciﬁc [1RM] and nonspeciﬁc [iso-\nmetric or isokinetic]), absolute occlusion pressure ( B 110\nor C 111 mmHg), cuff width ( B 139 or C 140 mm) and\nocclusion pressure prescription (individualized or non-in-\ndividualized) on muscle strength response. Similarly,\nadditional analyses were performed to investigate the\neffects of absolute occlusion pressure value, cuff width,\nand occlusion pressure prescription (i.e., individualized or\nnon-individualized) on muscle hypertrophy outcomes.\nGiven the inconsistency of absolute occlusion pressure and\ncuff width among studies and the inherent relationship\nbetween these parameters [ 23] we opted to cluster studies\naccording to the median values of these variables. That is,\nstudies were separated with values below or above the\nmedian values for absolute occlusion pressure ( B 110\nor C 111 mmHg) or cuff width ( B 139 or C 140 mm).\nImportantly, after the clustering procedure, all studies\nclassiﬁed as ‘‘narrow cuff’’ were the same as those clas-\nsiﬁed as ‘‘higher absolute occlusion pressure’’ and vice-\nversa. Furthermore, relative changes pre- to post-inter-\nvention were calculated (post-intervention 9 100/pre-in-\ntervention - 100) for both HL- and BFR-RT. A sensitivity\nanalysis was carried out to identify the presence of highly\ninﬂuential studies, which might bias the analyses. Thus, an\nanalysis removing one study at a time was performed, and\nthen examining its effect on between-group comparisons.\nStudies were considered as inﬂuential if removal resulted\nin a change of the ES\ndiff from signiﬁcant ( P B 0.05) to\nnon-signiﬁcant ( P [ 0.05) or if removal caused a large\nchange in the magnitude of the coefﬁcient. This procedure\nhas been adopted elsewhere [ 27]. Furthermore, publication\nbias was veriﬁed via funnel plot analysis. The signiﬁcance\nlevel adopted was P \\ 0.05. All data are presented as\nmean ± standard error.\nHL-RT vs. BFR-RT: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\n123\n\n\nTable 1 Summary of studies investigating muscle strength adaptations between high-load resistance training (HL-RT) vs. low-load resistance training ass ociated with blood-ﬂow restriction\n(BFR-RT)\nReferences Subjects Exercise Protocol N Weeks\n(sessions)\nExercise\nload\nMuscle\nstrength\nassessment\nPercentage\nincrease in muscle\nstrength\nAuthors’ conclusions\nClark et al.\n[15]\nAdults Bilateral knee\nextension\nBFR-RT:\n3 9 failure\nHL-RT:\n3 9 failure\n9\n7\n4 (12) 30%\n1RM\n80%\n1RM\nIsometric knee\nextension\n8%\n13%\nNo signiﬁcant between-group difference\nEllefsen et al.\n[19]\nAdult females Unilateral knee\nextension\nBFR-RT:\n5 9 failure\nHL-RT:\n3 9 6–10RM\n12\n12\n12 (24) 30%\n1RM\n75–92%\n1RM\nDynamic knee\nextension\n10%\n12%\nNo signiﬁcant between-group difference\nKarabulut\net al.

Then, titles and\nabstracts of the remaining studies were read, from which\n190 were excluded. The remaining 14 articles were fully\nread and 13 studies were considered eligible according to\nour previously set criteria. After multiple unsuccessful\nattempts to contact the authors, hypertrophy and strength\ndata from one study could not be included [ 28]. The search\nprocess is depicted in Fig. 1.\nTwelve studies investigating muscle strength gains\nbetween HL- vs. BFR-RT were included in the present\nmeta-analysis, resulting in 24 treatment outcome measures\nin 460 participants. Mean ES across all studies was\n0.74 ± 0.07 (95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 0.60–0.88).\nMean muscle strength percentage gain was 14.36 ± 1.53%\n(95% CI 11.37–17.35). Between-group comparisons\nshowed signiﬁcantly higher gains in muscle strength for\nHL-RT as compared with BFR-RT (ES\ndiff: 0.63 ± 0.09;\n95% CI 0.43–0.80) (Fig. 2). This was equivalent to a\npercentage gain difference of 7.36%, favoring HL-RT. A\nsimilar pattern was observed when considering test speci-\nﬁcity, with ES diff favoring HL-RT in either speciﬁc (i.e.,\n1RM; ES diff: 0.63 ± 0.11; 95% CI 0.41– 0.85) or non-\nspeciﬁc (i.e., isometric and isokinetic; ES diff: 0.58 ± 0.17;\n95% CI 0.25–0.92) muscle strength assessment (Fig. 3).\nImportantly, BFR-RT was still less effective when com-\npared with HL-RT even when accounting for absolute\nocclusion pressure and cuff width. Results from our cluster\nanalysis revealed that narrower cuffs at higher-absolute\nocclusion pressure or wider cuffs at lower-absolute\nocclusion pressures resulted in smaller strength gains when\ncompared with HL-RT (ES\ndiff: 0.52 ± 0.15; 95% CI\n0.23–0.81 and (ES diff: 0.68 ± 0.12; 95% CI 0.45–0.92,\nrespectively) (Fig. 4). Finally, occlusion pressure pre-\nscription method did not affect the results, as either indi-\nvidualized or non-individualized methods resulted in\nsmaller muscle strength gains as compared with HL-RT\n(ES\ndiff: 0.73 ± 0.18; 95% CI 0.39–1.07 and ES diff:\n0.57 ± 0.11; 95% CI 0.36–0.79, respectively) (Fig. 5).\nSensitivity analysis (i.e., removing one study at a time and\nre-analyzing the data) revealed that muscle strength results\nwere not highly affected by any single study (data not\nshown). Furthermore, funnel plot analysis revealed the\npresence of an inﬂuential study (Fig. 6).

    "discussion": "The present meta-analysis aimed to compare the effects of\nHL- versus BFR-RT on muscle strength and mass. The\nmain results showed higher increases in muscle strength for\nHL- as compared with BFR-RT, even when considering\nspeciﬁcity of the muscle strength test (i.e., speciﬁc [1RM]\nor nonspeciﬁc [isometric and isokinetic] testing). Impor-\ntantly, none of the BFR-RT characteristics investigated\n(i.e., absolute occlusion pressure value, cuff width, and\nocclusion pressure prescription) inﬂuenced the muscle\nstrength response (i.e., higher muscle strength gains for\nHL- as compared with BFR-RT). Regarding hypertrophic\nresponse, the overall results revealed similar increases in\nmuscle mass between HL- and BFR-RT. Muscle hyper-\ntrophy was not inﬂuenced by absolute occlusion pressure\nand cuff width, as both wider-cuff lower-pressure and\nFig. 2 Forest plot displaying\nthe overall ES diff for muscle\nstrength adaptations between\nhigh-load resistance training\n(HL-RT) vs. low-load resistance\ntraining associated with blood-\nﬂow restriction (BFR-RT).\nDifferent letters for the same\nstudy represent different\nprotocols.

Cook et al. [ 29] showed higher\nEMG amplitude during an acute HL- as compared with a\nBFR-RT session. Similar results were observed in the long\nterm, as 12 weeks of training signiﬁcantly increased sur-\nface EMG amplitude in HL-RT, with no changes in BFR-\nRT [ 11]. Furthermore, the authors observed a trend toward\ngreater increases in isometric maximum voluntary con-\ntraction (MVC) in the HL- as compared with BFR-RT\ngroup. Importantly, in this study, only HL-RT adjusted the\ntraining load throughout intervention, which might have\ninﬂuenced muscle strength results. Conversely, Takarada\net al. [ 28] demonstrated similar surface EMG amplitude\nacutely between HL- versus BFR-RT and comparable\nisokinetic MVC gains between protocols after 16 training\nweeks. Although these results are difﬁcult to reconcile, MU\nrecruitment estimated via surface EMG has been shown to\nbe problematic due to methodological limitations. Surface\nEMG is an indirect measure of MU recruitment,\nFig. 3 Forest plot displaying\nthe ES diff for muscle strength\nbetween high-load resistance\ntraining (HL-RT) vs. low-load\nresistance training associated\nwith blood-ﬂow restriction\n(BFR-RT) according to test\nspeciﬁcity.

In this regard, differences between protocols may be\nrelated to possibly different behaviors in recruitment, ﬁring\nrate, and MU synchronization. Thus, despite studies\nshowing possibly lower EMG amplitude during BFR- as\ncompared with HL-RT, MU recruitment cannot be properly\nmeasured with actual EMG methods, which are based only\non signal amplitude. Future studies should more compre-\nhensively investigate possible differences in MU recruit-\nment between protocols.\nIn addition to surface EMG, neural adaptations to dif-\nferent RT protocols have been evaluated through twitch-\ninterpolation technique, which estimates voluntary muscle\nactivation level to a given task [ 30]. However, to the best of\nthe authors’ knowledge, only two studies [ 11, 31] investi-\ngated voluntary activation levels after long-term periods of\nBFR-RT, and only one compared BFR- to a HL-RT pro-\ntocol [ 11]. For instance, 12 weeks of training increased\nvoluntary activation level by * 3% in HL-RT, with no\nsigniﬁcant changes in the BFR-RT group [ 11]. Although\nthese results suggest a potentially greater effect of HL-RT\non muscle activation, some concerns should be highlighted.\nAs mentioned previously, in Kubo et al. [ 11], only the HL-\nRT group adjusted the load during the intervention (per-\nforming additional 1RM tests at weeks 4 and 8); hence,\ngiven that this group not only routinely practiced with the\n1RM test but, also, and most importantly, progressively\nFig. 4 Forest plot displaying\nthe ES diff for muscle strength\nbetween high-load resistance\ntraining (HL-RT) vs. low-load\nresistance training associated\nwith blood-ﬂow restriction\n(BFR-RT) according to absolute\nocclusion pressure and cuff\nwidth.

ESdiff effect size\ndifference\nHL-RT vs. BFR-RT: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\n123\n\n\nincreased the load, the results may be misleading. Simi-\nlarly, others have not observed signiﬁcant increases in\nmuscle activation levels after long-term periods of BFR-\nRT [ 31]; however, this study did not include a HL-RT\ngroup, precluding more deﬁnite conclusions. Nevertheless,\nin conjunction, these results suggest that BFR- protocols\nmay be not as effective as HL-RT to increase voluntary\nmuscle activation levels, which is in consonance with our\nﬁndings regarding muscle strength.\nRecently, it has been suggested that differences in muscle\nstrength adaptations between RT protocols may be related to\ntest speciﬁcity [ 21]. Indeed, HL-RT has been shown to\ninduce greater gains in muscle strength than low-load RT\nwhen assessed by speciﬁc testing procedures (i.e., 1RM test);\nhowever, when muscle strength was evaluated through non-\nspeciﬁc testing (i.e., isometric MVC), both RT protocols\nshowed similar results [ 32]. These results are somewhat in\naccordance with the present meta-analysis, as we observed\nsuperior gains in muscle strength for HL-RT in speciﬁc tests.\nHowever, even when using non-speciﬁc tests, HL-RT was\nstill shown to be more effective in increasing muscle strength\nthan BFR-RT. Interestingly, it has been suggested that\nspeciﬁcity deﬁcit between different RT protocols could be\nmitigated by routinely practicing with 1RM [ 33]. According\nto the authors, adding testing sessions (i.e., 1RM tests) during\nthe intervention resulted in similar increases in muscle\nstrength between HL- and low-load RT, despite test speci-\nﬁcity theoretically favoring the former. The literature,\nhowever, does not support this contention when considering\nBFR protocols, as others have still [ 6, 7, 12] found HL-RT to\nFig. 5 Forest plot displaying\nthe ES diff for muscle strength\nbetween high-load resistance\ntraining (HL-RT) vs. low-load\nresistance training associated\nwith blood-ﬂow restriction\n(BFR-RT) according to\nocclusion pressure prescription\nmethod.

It is important to emphasize that both Morton\net al. [ 33] and Mitchell et al. [ 32] compared HL- with low-\nload-RT (and not with BFR-RT), with the latter encom-\npassing far greater exercise volumes than typical BFR-RT,\nwhich could account for the dissonant results.\nOcclusion pressure has been considered an important\nvariable within BFR-RT, as it is thought to modulate muscle\nadaptation [22, 28, 34, 35]. Nevertheless, occlusion pressure\nis highly dependent on cuff width [ 23, 36]. Thus, in order to\ngain insight as to whether absolute occlusion pressure could\naffect muscle strength response, we conducted a sub-anal-\nysis dividing studies into clusters according to not only\nabsolute occlusion pressure but also according to cuff width.\nImportantly, all studies within the lower absolute occlusion\npressure cluster were also the ones classiﬁed within the\nwider cuff width cluster. The results demonstrated that\nneither absolute occlusion pressure nor cuff width affected\nFig. 6 Funnel plot of studies\ncomparing muscle strength\nbetween high-load resistance\ntraining (HL-RT) vs. low-load\nresistance training associated\nwith blood-ﬂow restriction\n(BFR-RT).

This seems in line with current literature, as pre-\nvious studies demonstrated that neither occlusion pressure\nnor cuff width inﬂuence muscle strength adaptations to\nBFR-RT [ 6, 16, 37].\nIt is important to note that only a few studies within the\npresent meta-analysis used individualized occlusion pres-\nsure prescriptions [ 6, 7, 16, 20]. This has important\nimplications, as a given absolute pressure may impose\ndifferent degrees of vascular restriction depending upon\nlimb circumference, individual blood pressure, and cuff\nwidth [ 23, 36]. Thus, it has been suggested that individu-\nalized occlusion pressure determination, accounting for\ncuff width, may be a more appropriate approach in BFR-\nRT, preventing under- or overestimation of occlusion\npressure, and thus allowing a more accurate exercise pre-\nscription when compared to generalized occlusion pres-\nsures [ 24]. Despite these suggestions, when considering the\nocclusion pressure prescription analysis (i.e., individual-\nized or non-individualized), our results demonstrated that\nboth methods produce lower gains in muscle strength as\ncompared with HL-RT. Interestingly, previous studies have\ndemonstrated that when considering cuff width and\nindividualized prescription, pressures as low as 40% may\nbe all that is necessary to improve muscle strength capacity\n[6, 37].\nCollectively, these data suggest that HL-RT is superior\nto BFR-RT in inducing gains in muscle strength, even after\naccounting for possible moderators. Importantly, individ-\nuals engaged in BFR-RT can substantially increase muscle\nstrength capacity; however, this training protocol might not\nbe considered optimal. Interestingly, combining BFR-RT\nwith occasional HL-RT sessions may optimize muscle\nstrength adaptations and mitigate possible differences\nbetween protocols [ 13].\n4.2 Muscle Hypertrophy\nBFR-RT has been widely advocated as a valid strategy to\ninduce gains in muscle mass, with allegedly comparable\nresults to those of HL-RT. The present results corroborate\nwith these assertions and add to the current literature by\ndemonstrating similar efﬁcacy between protocols by means\nof a robust meta-analytic procedure. Nevertheless, BFR-RT\ncharacteristics such as occlusion pressure, cuff width, and\nocclusion pressure prescription method have been thought\nto inﬂuence training adaptations. In this sense, the present\nFig. 8 Forest plot displaying\nthe ES diff for muscle\nhypertrophy between high-load\nresistance training (HL-RT) vs.\nlow-load resistance training\nassociated with blood-ﬂow\nrestriction (BFR-RT) according\nto absolute occlusion pressure\nand cuff width.

It is important to highlight that con-\nsidering absolute occlusion pressure values irrespective of\ncuff width may be misleading, as occlusion pressure is\nhighly inﬂuenced by cuff width [ 36, 38].\nIn this respect, all studies classiﬁed as ‘‘lower-pressure’’\nwere also those clustered as ‘‘wider-cuff’’ and vice versa.\nThis analysis yielded similar results, as both variables (i.e.,\nFig. 9 Forest plot displaying\nthe ES diff for muscle\nhypertrophy between high-load\nresistance training (HL-RT) vs.\nlow-load resistance training\nassociated with blood-ﬂow\nrestriction (BFR-RT) according\nto occlusion pressure\nprescription method.

Our results\ncorroborate previous studies demonstrating that neither\nocclusion pressure [ 6, 37] nor cuff width [ 38] affect the\nmuscle mass response to BFR-RT. These results are of\npractical application as occlusion pressure was previously\nshown to be directly related to pain and rating of perceived\nexertion, suggesting that lower-pressure BFR-RT (hence\nperceived as more comfortable and less physically\ndemanding) could be effectively employed, particularly in\nthose individuals with lower tolerance to physical stress.\nAdditionally, the present meta-analysis explored the\neffects of the occlusion pressure prescription method (i.e.,\nindividualized vs. non-individualized) on muscle hyper-\ntrophy. Individualized prescription accounts for individual\nanatomical differences (e.g., limb circumference, fat and\nmuscle cross-sectional area), as well as for cuff width,\nallowing a more robust approach by avoiding under- or\noverestimation of blood ﬂow restriction to musculature\n[23]. Interestingly, both individualized and non-individu-\nalized protocols showed comparable hypertrophy to that\nwith HL-RT. This suggests that both prescription methods\nprovided sufﬁcient blood ﬂow restriction to the working\nmuscle, directly affecting fatigue and MU recruitment,\nwhich are often described to underpin BFR-RT-related\nadaptations [ 39–41].\nDespite the above, one may argue that the CIs for\nhypertrophy may show a trend towards greater response to\nHL-RT. Importantly, the ES\ndiff between RT protocols,\nregardless of moderators, translate to a difference lower\nthan 1% for muscle hypertrophy. The clinical relevance of\nsuch a small difference is debatable and may be conﬁned to\nspeciﬁc populations. Finally, although speculative, these\nsmall differences may be related to ﬁber-type speciﬁcity. In\nfact, there is short-term evidence to suggest BFR-RT to\npreferentially stresses type-I ﬁbers [ 42]; however, long-\nterm studies suggest otherwise [ 43, 44]. Importantly, data\non direct comparison in ﬁber-type-speciﬁc response\nbetween BFR- and HL-RT are still lacking.\n4.3 Limitations\nThe present meta-analysis has some limitations. Absolute\nocclusion pressure values are highly inﬂuenced by cuff\nwidth. Given the discrepancies between studies for these\nvariables, it is difﬁcult to understand what a given absolute\nocclusion pressure for a wider cuff represents on a nar-\nrower one and how it affects vascular restriction. There-\nfore, results must be interpreted with caution. In addition,\ndue to the sparse number of studies comparing BFR- with\nHL-RT, we could not perform additional analyses for other\nimportant potential moderators (e.g., volume, frequency,\nand sex). Studies included herein did not report pre- to\npost-correlation for muscle mass and strength, thus, we\nestimated these correlation parameters for all studies (see\nSect. 2.5). Importantly, the estimated values were very\nsimilar to those obtained from our laboratory, allowing us\nto assume that our estimations were within the expected\nrange. Finally, we were not able to include data from\nTakarada et al. [ 28]; however, according to our sensitivity\nanalysis we observed that no single study was able to\nsigniﬁcantly change the magnitude of response between\nprotocols. Thus, the lack of these data most likely would\nnot have changed the present results and interpretations.\n5 Conclusions\nIn",
    "conclusion": ", the results from the present meta-analysis\ndemonstrate superior muscle strength gains for HL- as\ncompared with BFR-RT, even when adjusting for potential\nmoderators (i.e., test speciﬁcity, absolute occlusion pres-\nsure, cuff width, and occlusion pressure prescription\nmethod). Regarding the hypertrophic response, HL-RT was\nshown to induce comparable increases in muscle mass\nwhen compared to BFR-RT, regardless of absolute occlu-\nsion pressure, cuff width, and occlusion pressure pre-\nscription method, supporting its efﬁcacy, despite\ndifferences in BFR-RT protocols across research groups.\nFrom a practical standpoint, individuals with special\ninterest in increasing maximum muscle strength may ben-\neﬁt from a more speciﬁc training method (i.e., HL-RT);\nhowever, when considering muscle mass accrual, both HL-\nand BFR-RT seem equally effective. Finally, it is important\nto highlight that BFR-RT is still a valid and effective\napproach for increasing muscle strength in a wide spectrum\nof age and physical capacity, although it may seem par-\nticularly beneﬁcial for those individuals with physical\nlimitations to engage in HL-RT.\nCompliance with Ethical Standards\nFunding The authors are grateful to Conselho Nacional de Desen-\nvolvimento Cientı´ﬁco e Tecnolo´gico (CNPq) for ﬁnancial support and\nFundac¸a˜o de Amparo a ` Pesquisa (FAPESP).
