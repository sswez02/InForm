    "introduction": "Skeletal muscle hypertrophy is one of the \ncentral adaptations to resistance training \n(American College of Sports Medicine, 2009). \nAccording to Haun et al. (2019), muscle \nhypertrophy can be assessed at the whole-muscle \nlevel (macroscopic",
    "methods": ") or the muscle fiber \nlevel (microscopic methods). Some of the methods \nused to measure muscle size at the whole-muscle \nlevel include B-mode ultrasound, computed \ntomography, and magnetic resonance imaging \n(Haun et al., 2019). Hypertrophy at the muscle \nfiber level is evaluated using muscle biopsy \nsamples and commonly analyzed according to \ntype I and type II muscle fibers. \nWhen prescribing resistance exercise, one \nof the most important variables is the external \nload. Current resistance training guidelines \n \nrecommend loads of 70% to 85% of one-repetition \nmaximum (1RM) as ideal for muscle hypertrophy \n(American College of Sports Medicine, 2009). \nHowever, recent research has established that \nboth low-load and high-load resistance training \nmay produce similar muscle hypertrophy at the \nwhole muscle level when the training is \nperformed to momentary muscular failure \n(Schoenfeld et al., 2017; Schoenfeld et al., 2020). \nDespite these established e ffects, there is also a \nlack of consensus regarding the effects of low vs. \nhigh-load resistance training on muscle \nhypertrophy assessed at the muscle fiber level \n(Grgic and Schoenfeld, 2018). \nAs compared to high-load training, some \nauthors have hypothesized that low-load \nresistance training may produce greater \n \n\n\n52 The effects of low-load vs. high-load resistance training on muscle fiber hypertrophy \nJournal of Human Kinetics - volume 74/2020 http://www.johk.pl \n \nhypertrophy of type I muscle fibers (Grgic et al., \n2018a; Ogborn and Schoenfeld, 2014). In contrast, \nhigh-load training is suggested to predominantly \nimpact type II muscle fiber hypertrophy (Folland \nand Williams, 2007). Grgic and Schoenfeld (2018) \nrecently performed a narrative review on this \ntopic. They concluded that while there is some \nevidence that low and high-load training may \nindeed produce different muscle fiber \nhypertrophy effects, the findings between studies \nremain highly inconsistent. \nIn a narrative review, there is no statistical \nmechanism for assessing the dispersion in effect \nsize from study to study (Borenstein et al., 2009). \nA meta-analysis, however, incorporates all of the \neffect sizes from individual studies in a single \nstatistical model and can isolate and quantify the \ntrue dispersion (Borenstein et al., 2009). Therefore, \nby using a meta-analysis, we might be able to \nprovide greater clarity to this topic. Accordingly, \nthe present paper aimed to perform a meta-\nanalysis on the effects of low-load vs. high-load \nresistance training on ty pe I and type II muscle \nfiber hypertrophy. \nMethods \nSearch strategy \nThe search for the studies was performed \nthrough ten databases, including Academic \nSearch Elite, CINAHL, ERIC, PsycINFO, \nOpenDissertations, Open Access Theses and \nDissertations, PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, \nSPORTDiscus, and Web of Science databases. In \nall of these databases, the following search syntax \nwas used: (\"high-load\" OR \"high load\" OR \"low \nload\" OR \"low-load\" OR \"high repetition\" OR \"low \nrepetition\" OR \"higher- repetition\" OR \"lower-\nrepetition\" OR \"exercise load\" OR \"training load\" \nOR \"traditional muscular endurance\" OR \n\"traditional muscular strength\") AND (\"cross-\nsectional area\" OR \"CSA\" OR \"muscle fiber\" OR \n\"muscle fibre\" OR \"type I\" OR \"type II\" OR \"type \nIIa\" OR \"type IIx\" OR \"muscle biopsy\" OR \"muscle \nbiopsies\" OR \"hypertrophy\"). After the initial \nsearch, secondary searches were conducted. These \nsearches consisted of: (a) checking the reference \nlist of all studies included in the review; (b) \nscreening the studies that cited the included \nstudies (i.e., forward citation tracking), through \nScopus and Google Scholar databases; and (c) \nexamining the reference list of previous related \n \n \nreviews (Schoenfeld et al., 2016; Schoenfeld et al., \n2017). The search for studies was conducted on \nFebruary 1st, 2020. \nInclusion criteria \nThis review included studies that satisfied \nthe following criteria: (a) published in English; (b) \ncompared the effects of low-load (defined as all \nloads ≤60% of 1RM) vs. high-load (defined as \nloads >60% of 1RM) resistance training; (c) the \ntraining sets were performed to momentary \nmuscular failure; (d) included humans as study \nparticipants; and (e) assessed muscle hypertrophy \nat the muscle fiber level. All studies that did not \nsatisfy these criteria were excluded from the \nreview. The most common reason for exclusion \nwas the lack of muscle hypertrophy assessment at \nthe muscle fiber level. \nData extraction \nFrom all included studies, the following \ndata were extracted: (a) details of the sample (i.e., \nsample size, sex, and participants’ training status); \n(b) description of low-load and high-load \nresistance training programs; (c) site of the muscle \nbiopsy assessment; and (d) pre and post-\nintervention mean ± standard deviation (SD) of \ntype I and type II muscle fiber cross-sectional \narea. In one case, relevant data was reported in a \nfigure; for this study (Lim et al., 2019), the data \nwas extracted using the WebPlotDigitizer software \n(2010-2019 Ankit Rohatgi). For studies that \nreported standard errors, the data were converted \nto SDs. \nMethodological quality \nThe methodological quality of included \nstudies was assessed using the Downs and Black \n(2000) checklist. This checklist evaluates several \naspects of the study design, with items 1-10, 11-13, \n14-26, and 27 referring to reporting, external \nvalidity, internal validity, and statistical power, \nrespectively. As performed in other reviews \n(Davies et al., 2017; Grgic et al., 2018b)\n that \nfocused on the effects of resistance training on \nmuscular adaptations, two additional items were \nincluded on the checklist (item 28 and item 29). \nItem 28 referred to reporting of training \nadherence while item 29 was related to the \nsupervision of the exercise programs. The \nmaximum score on the checklist was 29 points. \nStudies were rated as being of “good quality” (>20 \npoints), “moderate quality” (11-20 points), or \n“poor quality” (<11 points). \n \n\nby Jozo Grgic 53 \n© Editorial Committee of Journal of Human Kinetics \n \nStatistical analysis \nMeta-analyses were performed based on \nstandardized mean differences (SMD; Hedge’s g). \nSMDs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were \ncalculated using the pre- and post-intervention \nmean and SD of the muscle fiber cross-sectional \ndata and the number of participants in each \ngroup. Two separate analyses were performed: (1) \nfor type I fiber cross-sectional area; and, (2) for \ntype II fiber cross-sectional area. For studies that \npresented data on differen t subtypes of type II \nmuscle fibers (i.e., IIa and IIx), SMDs and \nvariances were calculated for each outcome \nseparately and the average values were used for \nthe analysis. The interpretation of SMD was based \non the following classification: small ( ≤0.2); \nmedium (0.2-0.5); large (0.5-0.8); and very large \n(>0.8). Heterogeneity was explored using the I\n2 \nstatistic with values ≤50%, 50-75%, and >75% \nindicating low, moderate, and high levels of \nheterogeneity, respectively. Meta-analyses were \nperformed using the rand om-effects model. The \nstatistical significance threshold was set at p < \n0.05. 95% prediction intervals were calculated \nusing: (a) the number of included studies; (b) the \nupper limit of the 95% CI; and (c) the tau-squared \nvalues. Prediction intervals denote the range in \nwhich the SMD of a future study conducted on \nthe topic will likely be. All analyses were \nperformed using the Comprehensive Meta-\nanalysis software, version 2 (Biostat Inc., \nEnglewood, NJ, USA).",
    "results": "Search results and study characteristics \nThe primary search resulted in 1849 \nreferences. Of this number of search results, a \ntotal of 50 full-text papers were read, and five \nstudies (Campos et al., 2002; Lim et al., 2019; \nMitchell et al., 2012; Morton et al., 2016; Schuenke \net al., 2012),\n with a total of 10 study groups were \nincluded in the review. Secondary search resulted \nin another 3131 results; however, no additional \nstudies were included. The flow diagram of the \nsearch process is presented in Figure 1. \nThe pooled number of participants in all \nincluded studies was 120. Study samples ranged \nfrom 14 to 49 participants (median: 17 \nparticipants). Four studies included only males as \nstudy participants, while one study utilized a \nsample comprising of females (Table 1). Four \n \n \nstudies included untrained participants; only one \nincluded resistance-trained individuals. The \ntraining program in the included studies lasted \nfrom 6 to 12 weeks. In all studies, muscle biopsy \nsamples were taken from the quadriceps muscle. \nThe included studies are summarized in Table 1. \nMethodological quality \nThe number of points scored on the \nDowns and Black checklist varied from 19 to 25. \nFour studies were classified as being of good \nmethodological quality, and one study was \nclassified as being of moderate methodological \nquality (Mitchell et al., 2012). \nMeta-analysis results \nA total of ten study gr oups were included \nin the meta-analysis. In the meta-analysis for the \neffects of low-load vs. high-load resistance \ntraining on type I muscle fiber hypertrophy, there \nwas no significant difference between the training \nconditions (SMD: 0.28; 95% CI: –0.27, 0.82; p = \n0.316; I\n2 = 18%; Figure 2). The 95% prediction \nintervals ranged from –0.71 to 1.28. In the meta-\nanalysis for the effects of low-load vs. high-load \nresistance training on type II muscle fiber \nhypertrophy, there was no significant difference \nbetween the training conditions (SMD: 0.30; 95% \nCI: –0.05, 0.66; p = 0.089; I\n2 = 0%; Figure 3). The \n95% prediction intervals ranged from –0.28 to \n0.88.",
    "discussion": "In this meta-analysis, there were no \nsignificant differences between low-load and \nhigh-load resistance trai ning on hypertrophy of \ntype I or type II muscle fibers. Even though it \nmight be tempting to conclude that these results \nindicate that muscle fiber hypertrophy is not \nresistance training load-dependent, non-\nsignificant test results are generally not indicative \nof the absence of a true effect in the population \n(Lakens, 2017). In both performed analyses, the \n95% CIs were wide, suggesting that the true effect \nin the population could be in different directions \nand anywhere from trivial to very large . \nAdditionally, for type I mu scle fiber hypertrophy, \n95% predication intervals ranged from –0.71 to \n1.28, suggesting that the next new observation on \nthis topic will likely fall within this very wide \nrange. Therefore, given the width of the 95% \nconfidence and prediction intervals, there is a \nclear need for future research on this topic. \n \n\n54 The effects of low-load vs. high-load resistance training on muscle fiber hypertrophy \nJournal of Human Kinetics - volume 74/2020 http://www.johk.pl \n \n \n \nTable 1 \nSummary of the studies included in the review \nStudy Participants Training programs Resistance \nexercise(s) used in \nthe training \nprogram \nDuration of the \ntraining; weekly \ntraining \nfrequency \nCampos \net al. \n(2002) \n16 young \nuntrained \nmen \nLow-load: 2 sets per exercise \nperformed for 20 to 28 RM \nLeg press, squat, \nand leg extension \n8 weeks; 2-3 \ntimes per week \nHigh-load: 4 sets per \nexercise performed for 3 to 5 \nRM \nLim et al. \n(2019) \n14 young \nuntrained \nmen \nLow-load: 3 sets per exercise \nwith 30% 1RM \nLeg press, leg \nextension, and leg \ncurl \n10 weeks; 3 \ntimes per week \nHigh-load: 3 sets per \nexercise with 80% 1RM \nMitchell \net al. \n(2012) \n12 young \nuntrained \nmen \nLow-load: 3 sets per exercise \nwith 30% 1RM \nLeg extension 12 weeks; 3 \ntimes per week \nHigh-load: 3 sets per \nexercise with 80% 1RM \nMorton et \nal.

The squares denote \nstandardized mean difference (Hedges’s g) while the lines denote their respective 95% \nconfidence intervals (CI) \n \n \n \nThe review's main finding is that when \nthe training is performed to muscular failure, \nthere is not enough available data to conclude that \nlow-load is more effective for muscle fiber \nhypertrophy than high-load, or vice-versa. \nHowever, we need to consider some associated \nphysiological responses to resistance training \nwhen extrapolating the data to practice. \nAccording to Henneman's size principle, motor \nunits are recruited in an orderly fashion \n(Henneman et al., 1965). At the beginning of a set \nwith low-loads (e.g., 30% 1RM), lower threshold \nmotor units associated with type I muscle fibers \nare recruited to lift the load (Duchateau et al., \n2006). As these motor units fatigue, higher \nthreshold motor units associated with type II \nmuscle fibers will be recruited, ultimately \nresulting in the recruitment of the entire motor \nunit pool. When exercising with high-loads (e.g., \n80% 1RM), the recruitment of all motor units \noccurs from the exercise's onset (Duchateau et al., \n2006). Therefore, if the training is performed to \nmuscular failure, the recruitment of high and low \nthreshold motor units may be similar regardless \nof load used in training. Similar recruitment of \nmotor units with low-load and high-load training \nmay, over time, also result in comparable \nhypertrophy of muscle fibers. Furthermore, recent \ndata reported similar hypertrophy of the soleus (a \npredominantly slow-twitch muscle) and the \ngastrocnemius (muscle with a similar composition \n \nof slow and fast-twitch fibers) when training with \nhigh-loads or low-loads (S choenfeld et al., 2020). \nThese results may be expl ained by the data from \nMorton et al. (2020), where no significant \ndifference in glycogen depletion of type I and \ntype II fibers and phosphorylation of relevant \nsignaling proteins was found between low-load \nand high-load training. When considering the \nwhole body of literature, it might be that the \neffects of high-load and low-load training on \nmuscle fiber hypertrophy are similar in terms of \ntheir magnitude. Nevertheless, given the already \nidentified limitations of the data (i.e., wide 95% \nCIs and prediction intervals), this topic needs to \nbe further investigated. \nIn the analysis for type II muscle fiber \nhypertrophy, the pooled SMD favored high-loads, \neven though the effect was not statistically \nsignificant ( p = 0.089). However, it is also worth \nnoting that the data from Schuenke et al. (2012) \nimpacted the pooled estimate in this analysis. \nSpecifically, the SMD from this study amounted \nto 1.01, which is substantially higher than the \neffects observed in other studies. When this study \nwas excluded from the analysis, the pooled \nestimate was reduced to 0.20 (95% CI: –0.18, 0.57; \np = 0.310). This study differed from other research \nby the inclusion of females as study participants. \nAll other included studies utilized samples \ncomprised exclusively of males. Tentatively, these \nresults may indicate that training with low and \n \n\nby Jozo Grgic 57 \n© Editorial Committee of Journal of Human Kinetics \n \nhigh-loads produces different effects on muscle \nfiber hypertrophy in females, but not in males. \nInstead of excluding females, future studies may \nconsider including both sexes and plot the results \nseparately to explore whether a sex difference \nexists to training with varying loads. \nIt needs to be mentioned that the results \npresented in this meta-analysis are specific to the \nlower-body musculature. Specifically, all studies \ncollected muscle biopsy samples from the \nquadriceps femoris muscle group, which is the \nmost common location because of its mixed fiber \ntype composition, trainability, and accessibility \n(Staron et al., 2000). Th erefore, while indicative, \nthe results presented here in cannot necessarily be \ngeneralized to the upper-body musculature. \nFuture research is needed to explore the effects of \nlow-load and high-load resistance training on \nmuscle fiber hypertrophy in the upper-body \nmusculature. \nUsing the Downs and Black checklist, the \nincluded studies were classified as being of \nmoderate or good methodological quality. \nTherefore, the pooled data presented in this meta-\nanalysis are not confounded by the inclusion of \nstudies that were of poor methodological quality. \nHowever, it also needs to be mentioned that \n \n \nadherence to the training programs was reported \nonly in one study (Morton et al., 2016). Adherence \nto any training program is one of the critical \nvariables that will determine its effectiveness \n(Gentil and Bottaro, 2013). In this context, one \nacute study reported that low-load training (20 to \n25 RM) produced higher degrees of effort, \ndiscomfort, and displeasure, as compared to high-\nload training (8 to 12 RM) (Ribeiro et al., 2019). \nThese differences in affective responses may \nimpact long-term adherence of participants to the \ntraining program; therefore, future studies should \nensure that adherence is reported.",
