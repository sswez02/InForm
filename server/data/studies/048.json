Data extraction \n \nCorrelation coefficients (adjusted and unadjusted), n (number of participants), beta \ncoefficients (standardized and unstandardized) for the relationship between protein intake \n(g/Kg/d or g/d) and bone outcomes were extracted, as well as bone outcomes by protein \nintake category. Data for calcium intakes were also extracted. For correlational studies \nlooking at the association between change in bone outcomes over time and baseline protein \nintake, or assessing associations between protein intake and bone outcomes at different time \npoints, all relevant data were extracted. This included mean and standard deviation (SD) for \nchange in bone indices over time, or else r coefficients or beta coefficients for slope of bone \nloss in different protein intake groups. It also included bone outcomes by protein intake \ncategory. \nFor studies presenting data on risk of fracture or osteoporosis/osteopenia diagnosis, odds \nratios, hazard ratios or relative risk estimates (with 95% confidence intervals) for the highest \nand lowest categories of protein intakes were extracted, with n and p if available. Mean and \nSD for protein intakes in cases and controls were extracted if no other data were presented \n(e.g. no risk estimates, no categories of intake data). \nFinally, for the intervention studies, as subjects were randomized at baseline, only the mean, \nSD and n for follow up measurements were extracted for each relevant outcome in each study \narm. Standard errors of the mean (SEM) were converted to standard deviations using the \nformula (SEM=SD/√n). Papers not providing complete data to calculate standardized size \neffects (i.e. not able to calculate the standard deviation, or the standard error of the mean) \nwere excluded from the meta-analysis if this data could not be obtained from the relevant \nauthors. Two authors of relevant articles with missing data were contacted. Neither of the \nauthors replied so their papers were not included in the meta-analysis, but the general \nfindings were included in the systematic review. Two other authors, whose papers had \n\n7 \n \n \n \nmissing data, or data only available in figures, was not contacted as previous contact when \ndoing the original analysis in 2007 was not successful. \n[2] Supplementary Results: Studies reporting correlation or regression coefficients for \nthe relationship between dietary protein and bone indices \n \nStudy Characteristics \nOf the 74 studies presenting data for correlation or regression coefficients, 18 studies were \nfrom South or East Asia (1-17), 21 from Europe(18-38), 2 from the Middle East (39, 40), 6 \nfrom Australia, Tasmania or New Zealand(41-46), 25 from USA or Canada (47-71) and 2 \nfrom South America(72, 73). Of these 74 studies, 12 were in children or adolescents (3, 17-\n21, 24, 25, 37, 38, 45, 48), with 1 study combining data from adults and children (44). Also, \n13 studies were in premenopausal women (1, 4, 14, 15, 29, 30, 32, 43, 47, 52, 57, 62, 74), 21 \nin postmenopausal women (2, 6-8, 11, 12, 16, 22, 33, 39-42, 46, 55, 59, 61, 63, 65, 70, 72), 7 \nin both pre and postmenopausal women(9, 10, 27, 34, 49-51), 2 in both peri and \npostmenopausal women(5, 53), 5 in men(31, 36, 66, 67, 73), 1 in pre, peri or postmenopausal \nwomen(26) and 13 in both men and women(13, 23, 28, 35, 56, 58, 60, 64, 68, 69, 71, 75). \nSixty-one studies assessed total protein intake only but 2 studies assessed both soy and total \nprotein(5, 8), one study assessed soy protein only(6), 10 studies assessed animal and/or \nvegetable protein intake in addition to total protein(7, 15, 16, 19, 20, 34, 47, 54, 58, 71) and \none study assessed soy, animal, vegetable and total protein(13). \n \nSystematic Review: Studies reporting correlation or regression coefficients, or protein \ncategory data \nSeventy-four studies presented correlation coefficient (r) or regression coefficient data \n(standardized (Beta) or unstandardized (B)) data (Table 1). \n\n8 \n \n \n \n \nCross-sectional data- BMD \nIn adults a large number of studies found an association between protein intake and Bone \nMineral Density (BMD) at the hip (23, 27, 32, 36, 39, 41-43, 49, 55, 58, 60, 66, 72), radius \n(4, 49, 57, 58), spine(9, 23, 27, 32, 43, 52, 60, 62, 63, 66, 72), total body (27, 55, 56, 58, 62, \n66, 68) or hand (HBMD) (55). Conversely, a large number of studies found that protein \nintake was not associated with BMD at the hip (1, 2, 9, 11, 22, 28-30, 35, 36, 47, 49, 50, 52, \n58, 60, 63, 65, 72, 73), spine (1, 2, 8, 11, 22, 28-30, 35, 39, 47, 49, 50, 54, 58, 60, 65), radius \n(32, 49, 53, 61) or total body (50, 58, 64). See Supplemental Material for a review of adult \nstudies assessing animal and vegetable protein intake specifically. In children, two studies \nfound that total protein and animal protein intakes were not associated with femoral neck \n(FN) BMD or lumbar spine (LS) BMD(45). However, two other studies conflicted as to \nwhether or not protein intake was associated with total body BMD (TBBMD) (45, 48). \n \nCross-sectional data- BMC and Bone Size \nIn children, seven studies showed that higher protein intake was associated with increased \nradial periosteal circumference, cortical area, volumetric BMC (vBMC) and polar SSI(18, \n38), as well as TBBMC(3, 24, 48), total body bone area (TBBA)(3, 24), total radial BMC \n(RBMC)(21), radial metaphyseal BMC(21), femoral neck BMC (FNBMC)(21), femoral \ndiaphysis BMC(21) and lumbar spine BMC (LSBMC)(21). Likewise, another study \nindicated that there was a positive association between dietary protein and forearm cortical \nBA but not forearm vBMC(25). However, one study found no association between child \nprotein intake and radial diaphysis BMC or total hip BMC (THBMC)(21) and another found \nthat total protein and animal protein intakes were not associated with total body BMC \n(TBBMC) or lumbar spine BMC (LSBMC)(19). In adults, a large number of studies found a \n\n9 \n \n \n \npositive association between total protein intake and RBMC(10, 32, 33, 44, 57, 61), \nTBBMC(55, 62, 72), Spine BMC (62, 67), LSBMC(32) TBBMC(68) and HipBMC(32), but \nthree studies found no association between protein intake and RBMC(33, 51, 67), humerus \nBMC(51) or Ulna BMC(51). \n \nCross-sectional data- quantitative ultrasound (QUS) and bone makers \nThere were no studies of BUA in children. In adults, four studies found that protein intake \nwas positively associated with calcaneal BUA(15, 34, 41, 52). In one of these studies total \nprotein intake was negatively associated with calcaneal BUA but the association disappeared \nwhen adjusting for animal: vegetable protein ratio(34). In terms of bone markers, in children \nthe one study assessing bone markers found a positive association between protein intake and \nbone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), but found no association with osteocalcin (OC) or c-\ntelopetide of collagen (CTx) (20). In adults, in four studies increased total protein intake was \nnegatively associated with hydroxyproline (HPO) (premenopausal women only) (49), \nCTX(42), pyridinoline (PYD)(8, 26), deoxypyridinoline (DPYD)(26) and type 1 n-terminal \nprocollagen (P1NP)(42). In contrast, one study found a positive association between total \nprotein intake and CTX(31) and other studies found no association between total protein \nintake and HPO (postmenopausal women only)(49), OC(8, 12, 27, 49, 50, 59), n-terminal \ntelopeptide (NTX)(12, 50, 59), DPYD(8, 12) or BAP(8, 12). \nSystematic Review: Animal, vegetable or soy protein and bone health \nStudies in adults \nIn four studies, animal protein intake was not associated with FNBMD (7, 47), LSBMD(7, \n47), TBBMD(7) LSvBMD(54), THBMD(47) or calcaneal stiffness index (13). One study \nfound a positive association between spine BMD and non-dairy animal protein intake in \npostmenopausal women aged 50 years or older, but conversely in premenopausal women \n\n10 \n \n \n \nfound a negative association (71). One study found increasing animal protein was associated \nwith increased THBMD, FNBMD, TSBMD, TBBMD(58). One study found a negative \nassociation between BUA of the calcaneus with animal protein, the effect being modified by \ncalcium intake (34). Finally, another study found that increased animal: vegetable protein \nratio was a negative predictor of FNBMD (16). \nTwo studies found that vegetable protein was not associated with FNBMD and LSBMD(7) or \ncalcaneal stiffness index(13). However a negative association was found in three studies \nbetween plant protein and spine BMD (16, 71) or TBBMD (7, 47) and hip BMD (47, 58, 71). \nInterestingly, one study found that higher vegetable protein intake was associated with \nreduced LSvBMD in persons of White (but not Chinese, Black or Hispanic) ethnicity (54). \nIncreasing vegetable protein was associated in another study with reduced THBMD, FNBMD \nand TSBMD in women but not men (58). Conversely, one study found a positive association \nbetween vegetable protein intake and bone heath for calcaneal BUA (34). \nIn terms of soy protein, four studies showed no association with calcaneal stiffness index \n(13), LSBMD(5, 6) , FNBMD (5, 6), TBBMC(5, 6, 44), THBMC(5), THBMD(6), or \nTBBMD(6), Troch/intertroch BMD (6) or leg BMC(44). However, two studies found that \nincreased soy protein intake was associated with lower DPYD(8) or higher LSBMD (8), but \nno association with PYD, ALP or OC(8). \n \nStudies in children \nIn children, one study found no association between animal (meat) protein intake and \nTBBMC or LSBMC, but did find a positive association between BAP and animal protein \nintake (19). However, there was no association between animal or vegetable protein intake \nand OC or CTX, or between vegetable protein and BAP(20). Conversely, another paper from \n\n11 \n \n \n \nthe same group found a positive association between animal protein intake and OC, CTX and \nBAP(19). There were no studies of soy protein intake in children or adolescents. \n \nSystematic Review: Studies reporting r values for slope of change in bone mass \nIn children, one study in boys found that baseline protein intake (age 7 years) was not \nassociated with FN vBMD, Total hip vBMD, distal tibia vBMD, FNBA, FN width, total hip \naBMD or FN aBMD at age 15 years when physical activity levels were lower (37), but \nprotein intake was positively associated when physical activity levels were higher (37). \nAnother study, in pre-pubertal girls with low calcium intakes, found increased animal protein \nintake was associated with lower gain in Radial BMC and TBBMC from age 10 to 15 years \n(17). \nIn adults, one study found no relationship between baseline intake of total, animal or \nvegetable protein and 3 year change in hip, spine or TBBMD(47) with another finding no \nassociation between protein intake and bone loss, also over 3 years (59). Another study found \nno association between protein intake and loss of LSBMD, FNBMD, THBMC or TBBMC \nover 30 months (5). \nSimilarly, one study found no association between protein intake during adolescence (15 \nyears old) and subsequent LSBMD or FNBMD in young adulthood (20-25y old)(28). Finally, \nanother found no association between BUA, BV or SOS in 18-19 year old women and \nprevious protein intake at 9-11 years old (74). No relationship between protein intake and \ntotal hip BMD(75). Sahni 2014 found a negative association in men between protein intake \nand % change in TrochBMD but not % change in LS or FN BMD in men, but there were no \nassociations at any site for women (60). \nHowever, some studies have found an association between protein intake and change in bone \nmass. One study found increased protein intake at age 20-25 years was retrospectively \n\n12 \n \n \n \nassociated with increased gain in TBBMC from peri-adolescence to the present day, in \nfemales with adequate calcium intake as well as all males regardless of calcium intake (64). \nOne study found that for every 20% increase in % of total energy from dietary protein, over a \n6 year period, there was an increase of 0.003 to 0.004g/cm2 for TBBMD, HipBMD and Spine \nBMD(70). Another study found reduced FNBMD and LS BMD loss (but no change in radial \nshaft BMD) over a 4 year period in those in with the highest (vs. lowest) quartile of protein \nintake(69). Finally, another study found an association between higher protein intake and \nreduced radial bone loss (BMD) in both pre and postmenopausal women(51). Another study \nin elderly women found a positive association between baseline protein intake and BMC 5 \nyears later with the highest daily protein intake tertile (>87g/d) being associated with higher \nappendicular and whole body BMC than the lowest quartile (<66g/d)(46). Finally, in one \nstudy of men and women aged ≥50 years old, there was a positive association between \nbaseline total protein intake and BMD 5 years later at the hip, as well as a positive association \nbetween protein intake and Spine BMD for both men and women, and with Hip BMD for the \nwomen only (71). \nConversely, one study found increased bone loss in men with higher protein intake (60). A \nnegative association between vegetable protein intake and % change in LSBMD, as well as \nbetween AP:VP ratio and FNBMD(16). Another study found increased bone loss in women \nconsuming high animal: vegetable protein ratio diets than those consuming low animal: \nvegetable protein ratio diets (76). One study found that higher quartiles of soy protein intake \nwere associated with protection against loss of TBBMC(5). Another study found no \nassociation between soy intake and loss of LSBMD, FNBMD, THBMC or TBBMC over 30 \nmonths (5). \n \n\n13 \n \n \n \nMeta-analysis: Funnel Plots and Sensitivity analyses for FNBMD and LSBMD models \nFunnel plots were conducted for the following models: FNBMD (unadjusted and adjusted); \nLSBMD (unadjusted and adjusted), BMD in postmenopausal women and BMD in \npremenopausal women. The FNBMD plot showed all studies within the 95% confidence \ninterval boundaries but there were a lack of smaller studies showing a negative effect \nestimate. The LSBMD plot had 3 out of 18 studies outside the 95% confidence interval \nboundary (strong positive effect sizes) showing, as with FNBMD, a lack of smaller studies in \nthe negative effect estimate area. The funnel plot for postmenopausal women BMD showed \nfew small studies with a negative effect, and the premenopausal women BMD plot showed 3 \nstudies out of 10 outside the 95% confidence interval area (strong positive effect sizes) and a \nlack of medium sized studies in the negative effect estimate area. Taken together, this \nsuggests potential publication bias in terms of smaller to medium studies, particularly those \nwith negative associations between protein and bone health, not being published. \nIn terms of sensitivity analyses, removal of each study in turn for the FNBMD analysis \n(confounder adjusted data only) had little effect on the above results. Sensitivity analyses \nshow effect sizes as follows when each study excluded in turn: Chan 2009 r(random)=0.07 (-\n0.04 to 0.18) R2=0.005 (0.5%) P=0.21, I2=47% P(heterogeneity)=0.15; Cooper 1995 \nPostmenopausal data r(random)=0.05 (-0.06 to 0.17) R2=0.003 (0.3%), P=0.37, I2=63% \nP(heterogeneity)=0.07; Cooper 1995 Premenopausal data r(fixed)=0.01(-0.05 to 0.07) R2=<0.001 \n(<0.1%) P=0.33, I2=0% P(heterogeneity)=0.67; Ho2003 r(random)=0.05 (-0.08 to 0.19) R2=0.003 \n(0.3%) P=0.43, I2=62% P(heterogeneity)=0.07. However, removal of the Cooper et al. (1995)(49) \npremenopausal data reduced heterogeneity to 0%, suggesting this study contributed strongly \nto the heterogeneity. Exclusion of this study also reduced the effect size from 0.07 to 0.01, \nsuggesting it was increasing the effect size substantially. However, the R2 was still very \nsmall (<0.1% to 0.5%) and not statistically significant when any of the studies were removed, \n\n14 \n \n \n \nor all included (0.2%). Therefore removal of studies had little overall effect on the pooled \neffect size. \nIn terms of sensitivity analyses for LSBMD (confounder adjusted data only), the following \npooled effect sizes were found when each study in turn were excluded: Ho 2003(6) r(fixed)=-\n0.021 (-0.14 to 0.10) R2=<0.001 (0.1%) P=0.73, I2=0% P(heterogeneity)=0.39; Cooper 1995(49) \nPostmenopausal r(fixed)= 0.02 (-0.06 to 0.11) R2<0.001 (0.1%) P=0.60, I2=0% \nP(heterogeneity)=0.68; Cooper 1995(49) Premenopausal r(fixed) = -0.01 (-0.08 to 0.07) R2=<0.001 \n(0.1%) P=0.88, I2=0% P(heterogeneity)=0.43. The pooled effect size was unchanged by the \nelimination of any studies in the model, suggesting no studies were having a strong impact on \nthe overall effect size. \n \nMeta-analysis: Associations with protein and calcium dose, as well as calcium: protein \nratio \nLinear, quadratic and cubic regression models (not controlling for confounders) showed that \nneither the calcium: protein ratio (calcium mg/protein g), nor the protein (g/kg/d) or calcium \n(mg/kg/d) dose, were associated with correlation (r) coefficients for the association between \nprotein intake and bone health for either LSBMD or FNBMD (P values were P >0.05 or did \nnot survive multiple testing adjustment (revised cutoff of P>0.001)). There was a positive \nassociation between protein intake and both FNBMD and LSBMD in the linear model (both \nP=0.02, b=0.33-0.39) and a negative association in the cubic models (P=0.01 (b= -0.90) for \nFNBMD and P=0.009 (b= -0.84) for LSBMC) but these models did not survive adjustment \nfor multiple testing (P>0.001). See Supplemental Table 6 for full details of these analyses. \n \n \n \n\n15 \n \n \n \n[3] Supplementary Results: Studies reporting fracture or osteoporosis risk \n \nStudy Characteristics \n \nOf the 29 studies (including six studies already reported in correlation coefficient or bone \nslope sections), 4 were from Asia (2, 14, 77, 78), 11 were from the USA or Canada (70, 71, \n76, 79-86) , 2 were from the Middle East (40, 87) 1 was from New Zealand(42) and 9 were \nfrom Europe (36, 88-95). In addition, 2 studies were by authors from the USA but reported \ndata from multiple countries (96, 97). \nIn terms of study design, 13 studies were cohort studies (70, 71, 76, 78-84, 88, 92, 94), 2 \nwere ecological studies (96, 97), 3 were of cross-sectional design (2, 36, 42) and 11 were \ncase-control studies (14, 40, 77, 85-87, 89-91, 93, 95). Of the latter, only 2 were prospective \n(nested) case-control studies (89, 93). In terms of fracture type, of the 13 cohort studies, 7 \nassessed hip fracture only(70, 76, 80-83, 94), 1 assessed hip, spine and forearm/wrist fracture \n(84), one study assessed hip and forearm/wrist fractures (79), two studies assessed all \nfragility fractures combined (71, 88) and two studies assessed all fractures (fragility and non-\nfragility)(78, 92). The 2 ecological studies assessed just hip fracture incidence (96, 97). \nFor the 11 case-control studies, 1 study was in children, assessing dietary protein intake in \nchildren with fracture compared with children without fracture (93). The other 10 studies \nwere all in adults, 1 assessing odds of hip fracture(86), 1 assessing odds of all fragility \nfractures by protein intake(91), 4 assessing differences in protein intake in hip, spine or wrist \nfracture cases and controls (89) or between osteoporotic/osteopenic cases vs. controls (14, 40, \n87), 2 assessing odds of hip fracture only by protein intake(85, 95) and 2 assessing odds of \nosteoporosis diagnosis by protein intake category(77, 90). \nIn terms of population studied, 6 of the 13 cohort studies were in postmenopausal women(70, \n76, 78, 81, 84, 88), 1 in pre and postmenopausal women(79), 5 in men and women(71, 80, \n83, 92, 94) and 1 in men only(82). In the 11 case-control studies, 1 was in children(93), 3 \n\n16 \n \n \n \nstudied men and women(86, 89, 91), 1 studied premenopausal women(14) and 6 studied \npostmenopausal women(40, 77, 85, 87, 90, 95). \nSix cohort studies and the 3 cross-sectional studies assessed total dietary protein only (2, 36, \n42, 70, 71, 80, 82, 84, 92), 1 studied animal protein only(94), 1 studied soy protein only(78) \nand 5 studied total dietary protein, animal protein and vegetable protein(76, 79, 81, 83, 88). \nThe 2 cross cultural studies assessed the relationship between protein intake and fracture risk \nin 16 (96) to 33(97) countries worldwide, with Abelow et al.(1992)(96) studying animal \nprotein only and Frassetto et al. (2000)(97) studying animal, vegetable and total protein \nintake. In the case-control studies, 7 studies assessed total protein only(14, 40, 85, 87, 89, 93, \n95), whilst 4 assessed total, animal and vegetable protein(77, 86, 90, 91). \n \nExclusion of studies from fracture risk meta-analysis \nStudies were excluded from the quantitative meta-analysis of fracture risk if they were cross-\ncultural studies(96, 97), had only data on risk of osteoporosis or osteopenia (2, 36, 40, 42, 77, \n87, 90), had effect statistics that were incompatible with other studies(70, 92) were the only \nfracture study in children (93) or reporting soy protein(78), only had results that were \nstratified by calcium (84), had missing data (76) or were case-control studies not reporting \nodds ratios (14, 89, 95). Case-control studies were analysed separately from cohort studies \ndue to methodological differences. Cohort studies presenting data on RR and HR were \nanalysed separately. \n \nSystematic Review: Studies reporting fracture or osteoporosis risk \nTwenty-nine studies reported data on fracture and/or osteoporosis diagnosis (Table 2), of \nwhich 28 studies were in adults and one in children (93). All studies provided multivariate \nadjusted estimates adjusted for multiple confounders (see Table 2) except for one cohort \n\n17 \n \n \n \nstudy (76) which controlled for only 2 confounders, 2 ecological studies (96, 97) which were \nonly adjusted for age, 2 cross-sectional studies which were only adjusted for BMI or energy \nintake(36, 42), 5 of the case-control studies(14, 40, 87, 89, 93) which presented only \nunadjusted data, and another case-control study which presented categories of intake (non-\nstatistically analysed) so confounder adjustment was not required (90). \n \n \nCohort studies- total protein intake \n \nThree studies found no association between total protein and risk of hip (80, 82) or spine \nfractures. In terms of fracture type, three studies found no association between total protein \nintake and either risk of combined fragility and non-fragility fractures (92), just all fragility \nfractures (71, 88) or hip fracture specifically (79, 81, 94). One study found an increased risk \nwith higher total protein intake (79) and another found the reduced risk with higher protein \nintake(70). Finally, another study found increased odds of fracture when calcium intake was \nhigh and protein intake was low, but this association was attenuated when both calcium and \nprotein were high (84). One study found the relationship between protein intake and fracture \nrisk depended on calcium intake(83). \n \nCase-control, cross-sectional and ecological studies- total protein intake \n \nThe one case-control study in children was of prospective (nested within-cohort) design and \nfound no difference in protein intake between fracture cases and controls (93). All case-\ncontrol studies in adults were of retrospective design, with the exception of 1 study that was \nprospective (89). Four adult case-control studies found no significant difference between \nprotein intakes in cases with osteoporosis vs. non-osteoporotic controls(90) or \n\n18 \n \n \n \nosteoporotic/osteopenic cases vs. healthy controls (14, 40, 87). In contrast, one study found \nincreased odds of osteoporosis diagnosis with higher total protein intake (77). Three studies \nfound no reduction in odds of being a fracture case in persons with higher protein intake \ncompared with low protein intake (85, 91, 95). However, one study found lower total protein \nintake (non-adjusted for confounders) in cases with fragility fractures than in controls(89), \nand two studies found an increased odds of fracture(36) or reduced odds of fracture (50-69 \nyear old subgroup) in persons with higher protein intake (86). The two cross-cultural \n(ecological) studies found a positive association between hip fracture and total protein intakes \n(97) and a positive association between hip fracture and animal protein intake (96), both \nstudies controlling for age only. Two of the 3 cross-sectional studies found that protein \nintake was a predictor of odds for LS osteopenia(2) or hip BMD below 0.83g/cm2 (men)(36), \nhowever the 3rd study found that protein intake was not associated with diagnosis of \nosteoporosis or osteopenia(42). \n \nSystematic Review: Animal, Vegetable and Soy Protein and Fracture risk \nIn studies that presented data on animal and vegetable protein, one study found no association \nbetween animal or vegetable protein and fragility fracture(88). Similarly, 2 studies found no \nassociation between animal or vegetable protein and hip fractures (79, 94), or found an \nassociation between animal protein intake and hip fracture in persons with lower calcium \nintakes only (83). Other studies found no association between hip fracture risk and animal or \nvegetable protein intake (86), or no difference in odds of being a fragility fracture case in \npersons with varying animal or vegetable protein intake (91). \nHowever, two other studies did find a significant association between animal protein intake \nand risk of forearm(79) and hip fractures(81), but one study found no association between \nvegetable protein intake and fracture risk(81). In addition, 1 study found an association \n\n19 \n \n \n \nbetween increased animal protein intake and increased hip fracture risk, as well as increased \nrisk of hip fracture with increased animal: vegetable protein ratio, and a reduced risk of hip \nfracture with increased vegetable protein intake (76). One study found increased odds of \nosteoporosis with higher animal protein intake, but lower odds with increased vegetable \nprotein intake(77). Finally, the 2 cross cultural studies(96, 97) found a positive association \nbetween animal protein intake and hip fracture incidence as well as a negative association \nbetween hip fracture incidence and increasing vegetable protein intake(97). The one cohort \nstudy assessing the relationship between soy protein intake and fracture risk (all fractures) \nfound a reduced risk of fracture in the highest intake quintile of soy protein compared with \nthe lowest(78). \n \nQuality Analysis \nTwelve cohort studies were assessed for quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Cohort study \nassessment tool(98) (scored out of 9). Three studies scored 4-5 (44-55%)(79, 88, 94), 8 \nstudies scored 6-7 (66-78%)(70, 71, 76, 78, 80, 81, 83, 92) and 1 study scored 8 (89%)(82). \nIn addition, 6 case-control studies were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa case-control \nstudy assessment tool (scored out of 10), with 3 studies scoring 3-5(77, 91, 95) and 2 studies \nscoring 6-7 (85, 86). The nested case-control study by Samieri et al. (2013) (89) (score=8 out \nof 9) was assessed using the cohort study tool as it was deemed more appropriate for the \nstudy design. As discussed previously, the cross-sectional studies were not analysed for \nquality due to the very large numbers of studies. It was not possible to formally assess the \nquality of the 2 ecological studies (96, 97) as there is no specific tool for this. \n \n\n20 \n \n \n \nFracture risk meta-analysis: Sensitivity and subgroup analysis \nSubgroup analysis showed that when removing Dargent-Molina et al 2008, (which was the \nonly study to include non-hip fracture results), pooled estimates were as follows: animal \nprotein intake, (RR (random)=0.83 (0.54 to 1.30, p=0.42, n=3 studies, I2=48% \nP(heterogenity)=0.14)), vegetable protein intake (RR(fixed)=1.20 (0.82 to 1.73, p=0.35, n=2 studies, \nI2=4% P(heterogenity)=0.34)), and total protein intake (RR (random)=0.75 (0.47 to 1.21, p=0.24, \nn=3 studies, I2=22% P(heterogenity)=0.28)). \nIn terms of sensitivity analysis, the effect sizes when each study were removed in turn were: \n(see estimates above for removal of Dargent-Molina): Animal Protein: Feskanich: RR \n(random)=0.91 (0.61 to 1.37, p=0.67, n=3 studies, I2=63% P(heterogenity)=0.07); Meyer: RR \n(random)=0.93 (0.63 to 1.37, p=0.71, n=3 studies, I2=63% P(heterogenity)=0.07); Munger: RR \n(fixed)=1.09 (0.97 to 1.21, p=0.73, n=3 studies, I2=0% P(heterogenity)=0.73). For Vegetable \nProtein: Feskanich: RR (random)=1.13 (0.63 to 2.05, p=0.68, n=2 studies, I2=48% \nP(heterogenity)=0.68); Munger: RR (fixed)=0.96 (0.86 to 1.08, p=0.51, n=2 studies, I2=0% \nP(heterogenity)=0.48). For Total Protein: Feskanich: RR (random)=0.76 (0.42 to 1.39, p=0.38, n=3 \nstudies, I2=54% P(heterogenity)=0.12); Munger: RR (fixed)=1.05 (0.93 to 1.17, p=0.43, n=3 \nstudies, I2=0% P(heterogenity)=0.43); Mussolino: RR (random)=0.99 (0.77 to 1.27, p=0.90, n=3 \nstudies, I2=33% P(heterogenity)=0.22). Therefore, for all protein types the removal of Munger \nrendered the heterogeneity down to zero, suggesting this study was the cause of the \nheterogeneity observed. Overall statistical significance of the models, for all types of protein, \nwere not affected by the removal of any study. \nFor the cohort studies reporting hazard ratios, removal of each study in turn led to pooled \nestimates as follows: Langsetmo (Men): HR (random)=0.87 (0.57 to 1.34, p=0.54, n=4 studies, \nI2=47% P(heterogenity)=0.13); Langsetmo (Women): HR (random)=0.82 (0.47 to 1.44, p=0.50, n=4 \nstudies, I2=50% P(heterogenity)=0.11); Misra: HR (random)=0.89 (0.58 to 1.37, p=0.60, n=4 studies, \n\n21 \n \n \n \nI2=41% P(heterogenity)=0.16); Sahni(High Calcium): HR (random)=0.84 (0.58 to 1.22, p=0.36, n=4 \nstudies, I2=49% P(heterogenity)=0.12), Sahni(Low Calcium): HR (fixed)=0.79 (0.64 to 0.97, \np=0.02, n=4 studies, I2=0% P(heterogenity)=0.66). The removal of Sahni (Low Calcium) data led \nto a statistically significant reduction in fracture risk when protein intake was higher. \nHeterogeneity was also reduced to 0%, suggesting this result was leading to a masking of an \nassociation between protein and fracture risk shown in the low calcium arm of the Sahni \nstudy and the other studies in the meta-analysis. \nFor case control studies reporting odds ratios the following effect sizes were obtained when \nstudies were removed as follows: Martinez-Ramirez: OR (random)=0.65 (0.26 to 1.65, p=0.36, \nn=3 studies, I2=73% P(heterogenity)=0.03); Nieves: OR (random)=0.57 (0.23 to 1.44, p=0.23, n=3 \nstudies, I2=47% P(heterogenity)=0.15); Wengreen (50-69years old: OR (fixed)=1.10 (0.53 to 2.26, \np=0.81, n=3 studies, I2=0% P(heterogenity)=0.98); Wengreen (70-89years old: OR (random)=0.61 \n(0.25 to 1.51, p=0.29, n=3 studies, I2=70% P(heterogenity)=0.04). All results were still not \nstatistically significant when studies were removed in turn. Of note, the removal of Wengreen \n(50 to 59 years old group) did make heterogeneity go down to zero suggesting this study was \nthe cause of the heterogeneity observed. There were not enough studies to perform funnel \nplots for each of the fracture meta-analyses. \n \n[4] Supplementary Results: Intervention Studies \nStudy Characteristics \nThe 30 intervention studies included 2 studies in peri-menopausal women(99, 100), 6 in \npremenopausal women(101-106), 12 in postmenopausal women(107-118), 6 in both men \nand women, of which 4 were elderly groups (119-122) and 2 younger or middle-aged(123, \n124), as well as 2 studies in men alone(125, 126) and 2 in children(127, 128). Seventeen of \nthe 30 studies were from USA or Canada (99, 101, 102, 107-109, 112-117, 119, 120, 123-\n\n22 \n \n \n \n125), with 2 from Switzerland(121, 122), 2 from Australia(111, 118), 1 from Brazil(110), 1 \nfrom Spain(128), 1 from New Guinea(127), 5 from Japan(100, 103, 104, 106, 126) and 1 \nfrom China(105). Eight of the 30 studies presented data on soy protein intervention vs. non-\nsoy protein control (99, 107, 111, 112, 114, 116, 117, 125), 6 presented data on milk basic \nprotein (MBP) vs. control (100, 103-106, 126), and 7 studies presented data on other protein \ntypes (110, 118, 120-122, 127, 128). Finally, 9 studies assessed dietary interventions, \ncomparing higher vs. lower protein intakes (101, 102, 108, 109, 113, 115, 119, 123, 124). \n \nJadad Scores \nSee Supplementary Table x for full details of study quality and risk of bias in the 30 \nintervention studies. In terms of Jadad scores (0-5, 5=highest quality), 16 studies were scored \nas 0-2(101, 102, 104-106, 108, 111, 113, 115, 116, 119, 121, 123, 126-128), 7 studies as 3-\n4(99, 100, 107, 114, 120, 124, 125) and 7 studies as 5(103, 109, 110, 112, 117, 118, 122). \nSome studies (101, 102, 108, 109, 113, 115, 119, 124) may have scored lower than expected \ndue to being dietary intervention studies, whereby it is difficult to undertake participant \nblinding as the different diets are difficult to conceal. Indeed, the Jadad scale is really \nintended for quality assessment of studies were participants and investigators can feasibly be \nblinded to treatment allocation. Study quality was variable, with many studies having \nsignificant methodological flaws. \n \nIntervention Studies \n \nNon-dietary Studies- Bone markers \nIn soy protein (vs. non-soy protein control) studies, six studies found no effect of soy protein \non BAP(99, 107, 114, 125), NTX(114, 117), DPYD or PYD(107, 111, 125). However there \n\n23 \n \n \n \nwas an effect of soy protein vs. milk protein on reducing both BAP and CTx in one \nstudy(112) and in another study there was a positive effect of soy protein on raising BAP and \nOC, but no effect on NTX(116). Of the three MBP studies reporting bone marker data, one \nstudy found no effect of MBP supplementation vs. inactive placebo on NTX and OC \nconcentration(100), another study found a lower NTX and higher OC in the MBP group than \nthe inactive placebo control(126) and the final study found lower NTX and DPYD in the \nMBP group than inactive placebo(106). \nFor total protein (vs non-protein control), protein supplementation was associated with \nincreases in type 1 N-terminal procollagen (P1NP)(120), HPO(124), DPYD(122, 124) and \nPYD(122, 124). There were conflicting results for CTX and OC with three studies finding \nno effect (110, 120, 122) one study finding a reduction in CTX (120) and one finding an \nincrease in OC (121). Finally, one study found no statistically significant for an effect of \nprotein supplementation on BAP (110). The only study in children found no statistically \nsignificant difference in BAP or OC or tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), but there \nwas a higher increase in CTX over the study period in controls (increase by 6% of baseline \nvalue) than in the collagen supplemented group (increase by 3% of baseline value). \n \nDietary Studies- Bone markers \nSeven diet studies found no differential effect of high and low protein diets on CTX (109, \n115), OC(101, 102, 109, 115, 119), DPYD(108) or NTX(108). Four studies found a lower \nNTX (101, 102, 119, 123) and two studies found that DPYD was lower(113) or HPO was \nhigher(115) in those taking a high protein diet (compared with a low protein diet). Finally, \ntwo studies conflicted in that they found either a higher BAP(102) or no difference in \nBAP(123) in those with a low protein compared with those with moderate or high protein \ndiets. \n\n24 \n \n \n \n \nSoy and MBP protein and BMD/BMC \nIn all supplementation studies no differential effect of soy protein vs. non-soy protein was \nseen for LSBMD(99, 112, 114, 117), LSBMC(99), FNBMD(112, 114, 117), RBMD(114) or \nTBBMD(112, 114, 117). Also, in a food based study (107) there was no differential effect of \nsoy or non-soy protein on both BMD and BMC at the LS, TB and TH. (107). For MBP, a \nstatistically significant effect of MBP supplementation in increasing LSBMD was found in \ntwo studies by 1 - 1.6%(100, 103) and in one study increasing TBBMD by 2%(105). \nHowever other results for MBP were conflicting, with studies finding either increased \nRBMD(104) or no effect on RBMD LSBMD or TBBMD (105). \n \n \nTotal protein and BMD/Bone size \nFor total protein, in malnourished New Guinea children aged 7-13 years, one study found an \neffect of 20g/d milk protein supplementation ( vs. no supplement) for increased periosteal \nbreadth, but not endosteal or compact bone breadth (127). In adults, no effect was seen for \nprotein supplementation vs. non-protein control on LSBMD(120-122), THBMD(118, 120), \nFNBMD(118, 120, 121) FSBMD(121, 122) or TBBMD(122). Finally, one study found no \ndifferential effect of high vs low protein supplement drink on TH vBMD or FN vBMD(118). \n \nMeta-analysis: MBP and Soy Protein Sensitivity analysis \nElimination of each MBP study in turn gave the following pooled estimates: Aoe 2005 \nMD(fixed)= 0.01 (-0.04 to 0.07) R2<0.001 P=0.69, I2=0% P(heterogenity)=0.69; Uenishi 2007 \nMD(fixed)=0.02 (-0.003 to 0.04) R2=0.0004 P=0.10, I2=0% P(heterogenity)=0.63; Zou 2009 \nMD(fixed)= 0.02 (-0.002 to 0.04) R2=0.04 P=0.07, I2=0% P(heterogenity)=0.07. Elimination of \n\n25 \n \n \n \neach soy protein study in turn gave the following pooled effect sizes: Alekel 2000 \nMD(random)=0.02 (-0.07 to -0.12, P=0.61) I2=52% P(heterogenity)=0.15; Kenny2009 MD(fixed)= -\n0.03 (-0.07 to 0.02, P=0.23) I2=8% P(heterogenity)=0.30; Vupadhyahula 2009 MD(random)=0.01 (-\n0.14 to 0.15, P=0.93) I2=75% P(heterogenity)=0.04. Removal of Kenny 2009 reduced \nheterogeneity from 51% to 8%, suggesting this study was contributing to the heterogeneity to \na large degree.
