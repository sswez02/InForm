    "introduction": "Older adults experience age-related changes in body\ncomposition, including increased body mass and fat\nmass and decreased lean mass, which includes skeletal\nmuscle.1,2 Age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass, or\nsarcopenia, is associated with impaired mobility, in-\ncreased risk of morbidity, and reduced quality of life in\nolder adults. 3 In addition to losing lean mass, older\nadults gain fat mass and the prevalence of overweight\nand obesity in the United States has progressively in-\ncreased during the past 3 decades. 4 The Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention reported that the prev-\nalence of obesity (body mass index /C21 30 kg/m2) among\nadults 60 years and older in 2011–2012 was 35.4%. 5\nObesity is associated with an increased risk of chronic\ndiseases and a reduced physical functioning capacity,\nboth of which contribute to disproportionately high\nhealthcare expenditures and premature mortality.\n6–8\nFurthermore, obesity may contribute to the loss of skel-\netal muscle mass or quality because of decreased physi-\ncal activity, skeletal muscle inflammation, leptin\nresistance,9 or impaired skeletal muscle mammalian tar-\nget of rapamycin signaling pathway,10 the key regulating\npathway for skeletal muscle protein synthesis. 11\nPurposeful moderate dietary energy restriction\n(500–750 kcal/d energy deficit) is an effective way for\noverweight/obese adults to reduce body mass and fat\nmass and improve their health profile.\n12–14 However,\non average, approximately 25% of the body mass lost by\ndietary energy restriction consists of lean mass. 15,16\nExercise training and nutrition are potential determi-\nnants of the quality of body composition changes that\noccur with weight loss.

    "methods": "The current study followed the PRISMA (Preferred\nReporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-\nAnalyses) guidelines. 21 The description of the PICOS\n(population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and\nsetting) criteria used to define the research question is\npresented in Table 1.\nData sources\nA computerized search of the literature was conducted\non January 23, 2015, using PubMed (http://www.ncbi.\nnlm.nih.gov/pubmed), Cochrane (http://www.cochrane.\norg/), Scopus (http://www.scopus.com/), and Google\nScholar (http://scholar.google.com/) databases. Search\nterms in PubMed included “dietary proteins” [MeSH]\nAND (“body composition” [MeSH] OR “muscle, skele-\ntal\" [MeSH] OR “muscle strength\"[MeSH]), and the\nsearch was limited to “human,” “English,” and “adults\n(19þ years).” Inputted search terms in Google Scholar\nalso included “dietary proteins” AND (“weight loss” OR\n“weight reduction\") AND (“body composition” OR\n“skeletal muscle\" OR “muscle strength”), and “English”\nwas selected as a limitation. “Dietary proteins” AND\n(“body composition” OR “skeletal muscle” OR “muscle\nstrength”) were used as search strings for Scopus and\nCochrane. Reference lists of the articles identified via\nthe PubMed search as well as those of a previously pub-\nlished meta-analysis\n20 and a meta-regression 22 were re-\nviewed to identify additional relevant articles.\nInclusion criteria\nInclusion criteria were as follows: RCT; subject mean\nage /C21 50 years; weight loss via dietary energy restriction\nonly (no concurrent exercise training); protein intake\nmodified by protein supplementation and/or a pre-\nscribed higher protein diet; and use of an acceptable\nmethod of body composition assessment. Acceptable\nmethods were dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry\n(DXA), air-displacement plethysmography, hydrostatic\nweighing, and assessment of total body potassium or\ndeuterated water, since these are considered reliable\nand valid methods to detect lean mass changes in older,\noverweight, and obese adults during weight loss. 23–27\nArticle selection and data extraction\nAll searches combined yielded 1536",
    "results": "(PubMed:\n708; Cochrane: 2; Scopus: 109; and Google Scholar:\n717), and 6 additional relevant articles were identified\nfrom other reference lists. All abstracts were indepen-\ndently obtained and screened by the primary reviewer\n(J.E.K.) and the secondary reviewer (L.E.O.). Of the\n1542 articles, 1518 were excluded for the following rea-\nsons: study was not a dietary-protein-related RCT; sub-\nject mean age was <50 years or no mean age was\nreported; study contained no dietary energy restriction;\nno lean mass measure was reported or lean mass was re-\nported only graphically; or study used an unacceptable\nmethod of body composition assessment, such as bio-\nelectrical impedance or skinfold thickness.\n28,29 The full\ntexts of the 24 eligible articles were independently\nassessed by the primary and secondary reviewers to fur-\nther assess inclusion eligibility and to avoid selection\nbias.

When possible, corre-\nsponding authors of the published articles were con-\ntacted via email to acquire unpublished data. When\nresults for male and female subjects 30,31 or high-protein\nintakes achieved using different sources of protein\n(chicken vs beef, whey protein vs mixed protein, respec-\ntively)\n14,32 were presented separately, they were treated\nas distinct interventions. In addition, results were in-\ncluded from studies in which postintervention measure-\nments were obtained after a combined period of energy\nrestriction and subsequent energy balance.30,31,33,34\nPrimary (J.E.K.) and secondary (L.E.O.) reviewers\nalso independently extracted the following information\nfrom selected articles using an electronic form: first au-\nthor’s last name; publication year; study population;\nsample sizes in each intervention; subject mean age, sex,\nand body mass index; intervention duration; total pro-\ntein intakes and sources of dietary protein in each inter-\nvention; amount of dietary energy deficit for weight\nloss; techniques used for dietary control; method of\nbody composition assessment; and pre- and postinter-\nvention and net changes in body mass, lean mass, and\nfat mass.\nAll of the studies included in this review measured\nbody composition using DXA. There were some\ndiscrepancies in how lean mass was reported, with 16\nstudies using the term lean mass, 1 study using the term\nlean soft tissue,35 and 3 studies using the term fat-free\nmass.14,36,37 However, for this review, these terms were\nconsidered synonymous and the term lean mass is used\nconsistently. After information was collected from cor-\nresponding authors or from elsewhere, 20 it was noted\nthat only 4 of the 20 studies included bone mineral con-\ntent within lean mass. 14,37–39 The studies that included\nbone mineral content within lean mass were included\nin the analyses because bone mineral content only ac-\ncounts for approximately 5% of total lean mass 40; more-\nover, bone turnover (remodeling) is very slow,\nrequiring a minimum of 4 to 6 months, and may con-\ntinue for 1 to 2 years. 41 In addition, weight loss in over-\nweight and obese individuals induces <1% of bone\nloss.42\nCritical appraisal\nThe risks of selection, performance, and detection\nbiases were evaluated from selected studies using a\nmodified Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias (see\nTable S1 in the Supporting Information online). 43\nDetails of methods for assessment of dietary control\nand body composition are also included in this table.\nFigure 1PRISMA flow chart of literature selection process.\n212 Nutrition ReviewsVR\nVol. 74(3):210–224\n\nCalculations\nFor this review, higher protein intake is defined as either\n(1) /C21 25% of the daily total energy intake from protein\nduring the intervention period, or (2)/C21 1.0 g/kg/d, calcu-\nlated by dividing the reported total dietary protein intake\nduring the intervention period by the mean of pre- and\npostintervention body mass. The 1.0 g/kg/d threshold\nwas chosen on the basis of a retrospective regression\nanalysis of data from 106 older men and women (com-\nbined from 6 studies) who completed 12-week interven-\ntion periods with known protein intakes and resistance\ntraining.\n44 Protein intake predicted the change in lean\nmass over time, with the regression line crossing\nthe point of no change in lean mass at approximately\n1.0 g/kg/d. In addition, a previous study estimated the di-\netary protein intake in US adults aged 51 years and older\nusing data obtained from the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey 2005–2006, and a protein\nintake of 1.0 g/kg/d represented the 50th and 75th per-\ncentiles of usual protein intake in men and women, re-\nspectively.\n45 Some articles did not report mean changes\nfor body mass,33,35,46 lean mass,33,46–48 or fat mass33,46–48\nduring an intervention period, and thus the estimated\nchanges from reported pre- and postintervention body\nmass and lean mass values were calculated manually for\nthe systematic review.\nThe mean and percent changes in body mass, lean\nmass, and fat mass and the percent body mass loss as fat\nmass and lean mass were calculated and each variable\nwas categorized according to different magnitudes of\nchange. Absolute change in body mass and percent\nchange in body mass, respectively, were classified as fol-\nlows: /C21 10-kg loss, <10- to /C21 5-kg loss, and <5-kg loss;\nand /C21 10% loss, <10% to /C21 5% loss, and <5% loss. These\ncategorizations were based on previous studies reporting\nthat the loss of 5 to 10 kg or 5% to 10% of body mass re-\nsulted in improved fasting blood glucose, blood pressure,\nand plasma lipid profiles.\n49–51 Changes in lean mass and\nfat mass were categorized as previously described 15 (for\nthe specific categories, see Table S213,14,30–39,46–48,54–57 in\nthe Supporting Information online), and the percentages\nof body mass loss as fat mass and as lean mass were cate-\ngorized on the basis of the widely cited rule that approxi-\nmately 25% of body mass loss will be lean mass, with the\nremaining 75% being fat mass for sedentary adults. 52 In\naddition, previous findings demonstrated that dietary en-\nergy restriction concurrent with exercise training attenu-\nated the percentage of body mass loss as lean mass from\n25% to 12% in young and middle-aged adults 53 and\nfrom 24% to 11% in older adults. 15 Each number in pa-\nrentheses (see Table S2 in the Supporting Information\nonline) represents an intervention, and the number of\ninterventions varied for changes in body mass, fat mass,\nand lean mass, since some original articles did not report\nraw data for all of these parameters.\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical analyses were conducted by using Stata/SE 12\nsoftware (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA), and\ndata are reported as means 6 standard deviations or as\nweighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confi-\ndence intervals (CIs). The overall effect sizes were calcu-\nlated using the Stata 12 metaan function, using either\nthe fixed-effects or the random-effects option, depend-\ning on heterogeneity statistics. Heterogeneity was as-\nsessed using chi-square tests and the I2 statistic. A\nsignificant chi-square test ( P<0.05) and an I2 statistic of\n50% or greater indicated heterogeneity in effect sizes\nbetween the studies and therefore warranted the use of\na random-effects model; when the chi-square test was\nnonsignificant ( P/C21 0.05) and the I2 statistic was less\nthan 50%, a fixed-effects model was used.\nRESULTS\nStudy features and subject characteristics\nTwenty articles met all inclusion criteria, and interven-\ntion-specific results were included in this review.\nDescriptions of the intervention features (intervention\nduration and dietary energy and protein intakes) and\nsubject characteristics (age, sex, body mass index, clinical\nhealth status) are summarized in Table 2. The degree of\nenergy restriction among selected articles varied, with av-\nerage energy intake ranging from 1250 to 1697 kcal/d\nand average energy deficit ranging from 500 to 750 kcal/\nd. The length of the energy restriction interventions\nranged from 8 weeks to 2 years. End-of-study measure-\nments were obtained at the end of an energy restriction\nperiod (15 studies) or after a 4-week period of energy\nbalance after an energy restriction period (5 studies).\nThere were 22 and 21 groups with normal protein intake\nand 24 and 19 groups with higher protein intake when\nprotein intake was expressed as a percentage of energy\nintake or as grams per kilogram of body mass per day,\nrespectively. The mean protein intakes of the normal\nprotein groups were 18% of total energy intake (range,\n15%–22%) and 0.79 g/kg/d (range, 0.58–0.97 g/kg/d),\nwhile the mean protein intakes of the higher protein\ngroups were 31% of the total energy intake (range, 25%–\n40%) and 1.31 g/kg/d (range, 1.01–1.57 g/kg/d).\nQuality of selected studies\nFour studies\n35,46,48,54 were deemed at low risk of selec-\ntion bias, since they provided specified methods of\nNutrition ReviewsVR\nVol. 74(3):210–224 213\n\nTable 2Study features and subject characteristics\nReference Mean age (y) Population and no. of completed subjects; diet characteristics BMI (kg/m 2) Duration (wk) Energy restriction\nJesudason et al.

However, 23% of\nthe normal protein group vs 13% of the higher protein\ngroup lost >3 kg of lean mass ( Figure 2 I), and 41% of\nthe normal protein group vs 21% of the higher protein\ngroup lost >5% of lean mass ( Figure 2 J). Moreover,\n48% of the normal protein group lost /C21 30% of body\nmass as lean mass, while 22% of the higher protein\ngroup lost /C21 30% of body mass as lean mass\n(Figure 2 M).

When higher protein intake was de-\nfined as /C21 1.0 g/kg/d, similar results in fat mass loss\nwere observed (Figure 2G and 2H).

    "discussion": "Guidelines for successful and healthful weight loss\namong overweight and obese older adults emphasize\nconsuming higher dietary protein when dieting. 12\nHowever, the scientific foundation supporting the po-\ntential benefit of higher dietary protein intake to mini-\nmize the loss of lean mass, including skeletal muscle\nmass, during diet-induced weight loss requires system-\natic review. This section considers the effects of the\nhigher protein diet on body composition during weight\nloss, the description of the higher protein diet, the\nchanges in lean mass vs skeletal muscle mass during\nweight loss, and the strengths and limitations of the cur-\nrent systematic review and meta-analysis.\nEffects of energy-restricted high-protein diets on body\nmass, lean mass, and fat mass\nResults from this systematic review and meta-analysis\nof findings from RCTs consistently indicate that older\nmen and women better retain lean mass while losing\nbody mass during periods of diet-induced energy re-\nstriction when they consume higher protein vs normal\nprotein diets. Qualitatively, about one-half (48%–50%)\nof the normal protein groups lost /C21 30% of body mass\nas lean mass, compared with 21% to 22% of the higher\nprotein groups; furthermore, only 9% to 14% of the\nnormal protein groups lost <20% of body mass as lean\nmass, compared with 39% to 42% of the higher protein\ngroups. These observations complement and support\nprevious research in young and middle-aged\nNutrition ReviewsVR\nVol. 74(3):210–224 217\n\nadults.13,17–19 Quantitatively, the current meta-analysis\ndetermined that older adults who consumed higher\nprotein diets (expressed as a percentage of energy in-\ntake) during energy restriction preserved about the\nsame amount of lean mass (WMD 0.45 kg;\n95%CI¼0.20–0.71 kg) as participants older than 18\nyears (WMD 0.43 kg; 95%CI ¼0.09–0.78 kg) in a previ-\nous analysis. 20 When protein intake was expressed as\ngrams per kilogram per day, higher protein-diet-related\nlean mass retention was also comparable for older\nadults (WMD 0.83 kg; 95%CI ¼0.47–1.19 kg) and youn-\nger adults who consumed >1.05 g/kg/d vs /C20 1.05 g/kg/d\n(WMD 0.60 kg; 95%CI ¼0.16–1.05 kg).22 These findings\nare significant because older adults typically present\nlower initial lean mass than younger adults, and older\nadults are also more likely to lose lean mass during\nweight loss.15\nComplementary to lean mass retention, higher pro-\ntein diets also increased fat mass loss. The analyses for\nolder adults showed that 76% to 78% of the higher pro-\ntein groups lost /C21 70% of body mass as fat mass, com-\npared with 52% to 57% of the normal protein groups,\nwhile only 22% to 24% of the higher protein groups lost\n<70% of body mass as fat mass, compared with 43% to\n48% of the normal protein groups; these findings are\nconsistent with those from a previous meta-analysis of\nresults from studies conducted in younger adults. 20 The\ngreater fat mass loss with higher protein diets may be re-\nlated to higher protein-diet–induced increases in whole-\nbody energy expenditure, including resting energy ex-\npenditure and thermic effect of feeding. 58,59 In addition,\nhigher protein diets may increase fat oxidation in over-\nweight and obese subjects. 60 Because few articles in-\ncluded in this review reported these results, findings\nspecific to energy expenditure should be interpreted with\ncaution. Only 3 articles 31–33 reported changes in resting\nenergy expenditure, 2 articles 31,33 reported changes in\nthermic effect of feeding, and no articles reported\nchanges in fat oxidation during weight-loss interven-\ntions. Two articles reported that resting energy expendi-\nture and thermic effect of feeding were reduced after\nenergy restriction, with no difference in resting energy\nexpenditure change between higher protein and normal\nprotein groups, but a significantly smaller reduction of\nthermic effect of feeding in higher protein group com-\npared with normal protein group was observed. The\nsmaller reduction in thermic effect of feeding with higher\nprotein vs normal protein diets\n31,33 is consistent with\nother research. 61–63 While higher protein diets appar-\nently influence both fat mass loss and thermic effect of\nfeeding, more research is needed to establish associations\nbetween these two parameters and to assess cause-and-\neffect relationships. Nonetheless, these results collectively\nindicate that consuming higher dietary protein during\nweight loss improves body composition by helping retain\nlean mass and reduce fat mass.\nDescription of higher protein intake\nThe positive effects of higher protein diets on lean mass\nretention and fat mass reduction during weight loss\nwere observed when higher protein intakes were de-\nfined as either /C21 25% of the daily total energy intake or\n/C21 1.0 g/kg/d. However, there were modest differences in\nthe number of intervention groups included in these\ntwo analyses because not all interventions classified as\nhigher protein on the basis of percentage of energy in-\ntake had protein intakes /C21 1.0 g/kg/d: 2 higher protein\ngroups in 1 study 14 consumed <1.0 g/kg/d (0.86 and\n0.93 g/kg/d). From a metabolic perspective, it seems\npreferable to assess the impact of protein intake on out-\ncomes of interest on the basis of the quantity consumed\n(g/kg/d) rather than a relative proportion of energy in-\ntake (percentage of daily energy intake) because the\nquantity of protein consumed contributes to amino\nacid bioavailability. Consistent with this perspective,\nlean mass retention was greater when higher protein\ngroups were classified using grams per kilogram per\nday ( Figure 6 ) vs percentage of daily energy intake\n(Figure 5 ): WMDs (95%CIs) were 0.83 (0.47–1.19) kg\nand 0.45 (0.20–0.71) kg, respectively. Researchers\nshould be encouraged to provide sufficient and detailed\ndietary and body mass information for macronutrient\nintakes to be expressed both quantitatively and in pro-\nportion to energy intake before (baseline) and at the\nstart and end of weight-loss interventions.\nChanges in lean mass compared with changes in\nskeletal muscle mass\nIn adults, body composition changes with advancing\nage: overall lean mass is reduced, which is mainly due\nto reduced skeletal muscle mass, while nonmuscle lean\nmass, such as organs and connective tissues, is re-\ntained.\n64 The fact that differential changes in lean mass\nwith higher protein vs normal protein diets during\nweight loss seem to occur in young 20,22 as well as older\nadults is meaningful because older adults present lower\ninitial lean mass than younger adults in general. New\nRCTs are needed to directly assess the effects of higher\nprotein vs normal protein intakes on energy\nrestriction–induced changes in body composition (in-\ncluding skeletal muscle mass) in young and older adults,\nespecially older adults with sarcopenic obesity.\nWhile changes in lean mass measured using DXA\nare often attributed to changes in skeletal muscle mass,\nthis inference should be made with caution.

Although primary and secondary re-\nviewers thoroughly and independently reviewed\narticles, the potential influence of publication bias may\nstill exist. In addition, this review is limited to changes\nin soft tissue body composition (lean mass and fat\nmass) and does not address the potential impact of pro-\ntein intake on energy restriction–induced changes in\nskeletal bone or indices of health and functional well-\nbeing. Nonetheless, this work makes a unique contribu-\ntion as the first systematic review and meta-analysis to\nuse both qualitative and quantitative assessments to\ndocument the impact of higher protein intake on diet-\ninduced changes in body mass and body composition\nin adults 50 years and older.\nT h ea s s e s s m e n to ft h ei m p a c to fp r o t e i ni n t a k eo n\nchanges in body mass and body composition on the\nbasis of the quantity of protein consumed (g/kg/d) vs a\nrelative proportion of energy intake (percentage of\ndaily energy intake) is novel and of importance for die-\ntitians and other healthcare providers who work with\nolder adults to help them lose weight. While counsel-\ning people to consume protein on the basis of grams\nper kilogram per day is recommended, reasonably\ncomparable results were obtained when protein intake\nwas consumed on the basis of percentage of energy in-\ntake. If the latter method is used to recommend pro-\ntein intakes, it is important to make sure that total\nprotein intakes are above the recommended dietary al-\nlowance of 0.8 g/kg/d, and preferably above 1.0 g/kg/d.\nIt is also important to be mindful that the acceptable\nmacronutrient distribution range for protein (10%–\n35% of total energy intake) is only applicable to states\nof energy balance. In energy restriction states, crudely\nthe percentage of energy consumed as protein should\nbe increased by about 5% to retain the same quantity\no fp r o t e i ni nt h ed i e t .\nCONCLUSION\nIn summary, the findings of this systematic review and\nmeta-analysis provide support that men and women\naged 50 years and older better retain lean mass while los-\ning fat mass when they consume energy-restricted\nhigher-protein rather than normal-protein diets.\nInformation gained from this review strengthens the sci-\nentific foundation for older overweight and obese adults\nto consume protein intakes /C21 1.0 g/kg/d to help preserve\nlean mass as part of a successful weight-loss intervention.\nAcknowledgments\nAuthor contributions.
