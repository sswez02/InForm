J\nStrength Cond Res31(12): 3508–3523, 2017—The purpose\nof this article was to conduct a systematic review of the current\nbody of literature and a meta-analysis to compare changes in\nstrength and hypertrophy between low- vs. high-load\nresistance training protocols. Searches of PubMed/MEDLINE,\nCochrane Library, and Scopus were conducted for studies that\nmet the following criteria: (a) an experimental trial involving both\nlow-load training [ #60% 1 repetition maximum (1RM)] and\nhigh-load training ( .60% 1RM); (b) with all sets in the training\nprotocols being performed to momentary muscular failure; (c)\nat least one method of estimating changes in muscle mass or\ndynamic, isometric, or isokinetic strength was used; (d) the\ntraining protocol lasted for a minimum of 6 weeks; (e) the study\ninvolved participants with no known medical conditions or in-\njuries impairing training capacity. A total of 21 studies were\nultimately included for analysis. Gains in 1RM strength were\nsigniﬁcantly greater in favor of high- vs. low-load training,\nwhereas no signiﬁcant differences were found for isometric\nstrength between conditions. Changes in measures of muscle\nhypertrophy were similar between conditions. The ﬁndings\nindicate that maximal strength beneﬁts are obtained from the\nuse of heavy loads while muscle hypertrophy can be equally\nachieved across a spectrum of loading ranges.\nKEY WORDS heavy loading, light loading, muscle mass,\nmuscle strength, repetition maximum continuum",
    "introduction": "C\nurrent resistance training (RT) guidelines profess\nthat loads in excess of 70% 1 repetition maximum\n(RM) are required to maximize adaptations in\nmuscular strength and hypertrophy (2). Similarly,\nthe so-called “RM continuum” purports that gains in mus-\ncular strength are optimal with loads of 1–5RM and hyper-\ntrophic gains are best achieved with loads of 6–12RM (5).\nThese recommendations are predicated on the belief that\nheavy loads are necessary to recruit the highest threshold\nmotor units (MUs) responsible for promoting maximal mus-\ncular adaptations.\nIt remains debatable as to whether lighter load training is\ncapable of recruiting the entire MU pool during a given set\nof repetitions. Prevailing research indicates that muscle ﬁber\nrecruitment follows the size principle, which dictates that\nthe smallest MUs are recruited ﬁrst during a given move-\nment with successively larger MUs engaged as force pro-\nduction requirements increase (21). Although this would\nseem to support the need for heavy loads to maximize mus-\ncular adaptations, some researchers have alternatively pos-\ntulated that training with intensities as low as 30% 1RM will\nultimately result in complete MU recruitment provided sets\nare carried out to momentary muscular failure (8,10).\nSurface electromyography (sEMG) studies consistently\nshow lower mean electrical amplitudes when training at low\n(,50% 1RM) vs. high ( .70% 1RM) intensities of load, even\nwhen sets are carried out to muscular failure (24,41). Con-\nversely, others have demonstrated comparable peak EMG\namplitudes between high- and low-load training, and mod-\nerate- and high-load training, and such discrepant ﬁndings\nmay result from differing",
    "methods": "of analysis through the\ntime-course of a set to failure (18,40). It should be noted that\nsEMG amplitude is not only a function of recruitment but\nalso includes factors such as rate coding (ﬁring frequency),\nsynchronization (simultaneous discharge of MUs), propaga-\ntion velocity (speed at which an action potential travels\nalong the membrane of a muscle ﬁber), and intracellular\nAddress correspondence to Brad J.

These factors, in turn, can be inﬂu-\nenced by exercise-induced fatigue, thus potentially con-\nfounding the ability to draw inferences as to the effects of\nloading intensity from EMG ﬁndings. Moreover, it has been\nposited that MUs may momentarily de-recruit and re-recruit\n(MU “cycling”) throughout a light-load set of repetitions to\nmaintain force output (16), thereby altering the magnitude of\nsEMG amplitude. Importantly, the level of sEMG amplitude\ndoes not necessarily correlate with long-term exercise-\ninduced increases in strength and hypertrophy, and thus,",
    "conclusions": "must be tempered in the context of these\nlimitations.\nUltimately, determination of causality on the topic requires\nlongitudinal studies that direct ly investigate the effects of RT\nusing low vs. high loads. A meta-analysis of such trials by\nSchoenfeld et al. (43) concluded that both high- and low-load\ntraining produced signiﬁcant increases in both muscle strength\nand hypertrophy, but noted that statistical probability favored\nthe heavier load conditions for both outcomes. At the time of\nthat search (December 2013), only 9 studies met inclusion\ncriteria, limiting statistical power of the analysis. Subsequently,\nthere have been a number of additional studies published on\nthe topic (4,14,15,32), providing a greater ability to draw prac-\ntical inferences and carry out subanalysis of potential covariates.\nTherefore, the purpose of this article was to conduct a system-\natic review of the current body of literature and a meta-analysis\nto compare changes in strength and hypertrophy between low-\nvs. high-load RT protocols.\nMETHODS\nInclusion Criteria\nOur analysis was conﬁned to studies published in English-\nlanguage peer-reviewed journals that met the following\ncriteria: (a) an experimental trial involving both low-load\ntraining ( #60% 1RM) and high-load training ( .60% 1RM);\n(b) with all sets in the training protocols being performed to\nmomentary muscular failure; (c) at least one method of esti-\nmating changes in muscle mass or dynamic, isometric, or\nisokinetic strength was used; (d) the training protocol lasted\nfor a minimum of 6 weeks; (e) the study involved participants\nwith no known medical conditions or injuries impairing train-\ning capacity.

Searches of PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane\nLibrary, and Scopus were conducted from inception of index-\ning to March 201 7. The following syntax was used to carry out\nthe search: muscle hypertrophy AND muscle strength AND\n(skeletal muscle OR resistance training OR cross-sectional\narea OR growth OR training intensity OR training load OR\nhigh load OR low load OR muscle ﬁbers OR loading OR\nmuscle thickness OR bodybuilding OR ﬁtness). The reference\nlists of articles retrieved in the search were subsequently\nperused for any additional articles that had potential applica-\nbility to the topic as outlined by Greenhalgh and Peacock (19).\nForward citation tracking of the studies meeting the inclusion\ncriteria was performed in Google Scholar. T o reduce the\npotential for selection bias, each of these studies were inde-\npendently perused by 2 of the investigators (B.J.S. and J.G.),\nand a mutual decision was made as to whether they met basic\ninclusion criteria. Any interreviewer disagreements were set-\ntled by consensus or consultation with the third investigator\n(D.O.).\nOf the studies initially reviewed, 49 were determined to be\npotentially relevant to the topic based on information\ncontained in the abstracts. Full text of these articles were\nthen screened and 24 studies were regarded as suitable for\ninclusion based on the criteria outlined. Attempts were made\nto contact the authors of a given study in the case that\nrelevant data were missing. Three studies (27,53,54) had to\nbe omitted from analysis because of lack of adequate data,\nhence leaving 21 studies for analysis. Figure 1 shows a ﬂow\nchart of the literature search. Table 1 summarizes the studies\nincluded for analysis.\nCoding of Studies\nStudies were read and individually coded by 2 of the\ninvestigators (B.J.S. and J.G.) for the following variables: (a)\nauthors, title, and year of publication; (b) participant\ninformation, such as sample size, gender, age, and training\nstatus. For age, the following classiﬁcation was used:\nparticipants aged 18–39 years are classiﬁed as young adults,\nparticipants aged 40–64 years are classiﬁed as middle-aged\nadults, and participants aged 65 years and older are classiﬁed\nas older adults. Training status was categorized as in the\nstudy by Schoenfeld et al. (43); (c) description of the training\nintervention, including duration, the intensity of load, weekly\ntraining frequency, RT exercises, and where reported, the\ntempo, and rest interval length; (d) methods used for the\nassessment of hypertrophy. Methods of measurement were\nclassiﬁed as direct (magnetic resonance imaging, computerized\ntomography, and ultrasound), indirect (skinfolds, dual-energy\nx-ray absorptiometry, and air displacement plethysmography)\nand in vitro (i.e., biopsy); (e) test(s) used for assessing strength\noutcomes [isokinetic knee extension and/or ﬂexion, maximal\nvoluntary contraction and/or maximal dynamic strength (i.e.,\n1RM)]; (f) region/muscle of body measured (upper, lower, or\nboth); (g) preintervention and postintervention mean 6 SD\nvalues related to hypertrophy and strength outcomes; (h) re-\nported adverse effects and adherence to the training program.\nCoding ﬁles were cross-checked between the authors, with",

(11).\nPer case agreement was determined by dividing the number of\nvariables coded the same by the total number of variables.\nAcceptance required a mean agreement of 90%.\nMethodological Quality\nThe quality of each study was independently assessed by 2\nof the authors (J.G. and B.J.S.), and agreement was mutually\ndetermined for any observed discrepancies. Study quality\nwas evaluated by use of the 11-point Physiotherapy\nEvidence Database (PEDro) scale, which has been shown\nto be a valid measure of the methodologic quality of\nrandomized trials (13) and displays acceptable interrater\nreliability (33). Given that the assessors are rarely blinded,\nand that is impossible to blind the participants and inves-\ntigators, in supervised exerci se interventions, we elected to\nremove items 5–7 from the scale, which are speciﬁc to\nblinding. With the removal of these items, the maximum\nresult on the modiﬁed PEDro 8-point scale was 7 (i.e., the\nﬁrst item is not included in the total score). The qualitative\nmethodology ratings were adjusted similar to that used in\nprevious exercise-related systematic reviews (26) as fol-\nlows: 6–7 = “excellent”; 5 = “good”; 4 = “moderate”; and,\n0–3 = “poor.”\nCalculation of Effect Size\nFor each hypertrophy outcome, an effect size (ES) was\ncalculated as the pretest-posttest change, divided by the\npooled pretest SD (31). A percentage change from pretest to\nposttest was also calculated. An adjustment for small sample\nbias was applied to each ES (31). The variance around each\nES was calculated using the sample size in each study and\nmean ES across all studies (7).\nStatistical Analyses\nA random-effects model was employed using robust vari-\nance meta-regression for multilevel data structures, with\nadjustments for small samples (20,49). Study was used as the\nclustering variable to account for correlated effects within\nstudies. Observations were weighted by the inverse of the\nsampling variance. Model parameters were estimated by the\nmethod of restricted maximum likelihood (48). Separate\nmeta-regressions were performed on ESs for 1RM, isometric\nstrength, isokinetic strength, body composition, direct as-\nsessments of muscle size, and muscle ﬁber size via biopsy.\nLoad classiﬁcation (high or low) was included as a moderator\nJournal of Strength and Conditioning Research\nthe TM\n| www.nsca.com\nVOLUME 31 | NUMBER 12 | DECEMBER 2017 |3517\nCopyright © National Strength and Conditioning Association Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\n\nin all regression models. To assess the practical signiﬁcance\nof the outcomes, the equivalent percent change was calcu-\nlated for each meta-regression outcome. To allow generation\nof a forest plot, mean differences in ESs were calculated for\neach study to give a study-level ES, and a meta-regression\nwas performed on those ESs. To explore whether an inter-\naction existed between training load and upper- or lower-\nbody muscle groups, separate regressions were performed on\ntraining load and its\ninteraction with body\nhalf (upper or lower) if\nsufﬁcient data were\navailable.\nTo identify the pres-\nence of highly inﬂuen-\ntial studies that might\nbias the analysis, a sen-\nsitivity analysis was car-\nried out for each model\nby removing one study\nat a time and then\nexamining the training\nload predictor. Studies\nwere identiﬁed as inﬂu-\nential if removal re-\nsulted in a change of the predictor going from\nsigniﬁcant or a trend ( p # 0.10) to nonsigniﬁcant ( p .\n0.10), or vice versa, or if removal caused a large change in\nthe magnitude of the coefﬁcient.\nAll analyses were performed using package metafor in R\nversion 3.3.2 (The R Foundation for Statistical Comput-\ning, Vienna, Austria). Effects were considered signiﬁcant\nat p # 0.05, and trends were declared at 0.05 , p # 0.10.\nFigure 2. Forest plot of studies comparing changes in 1RM strength in high- vs. low-load training.

This fairly large body of research provided ample\nstatistical power to draw inferences as to the effects of load-\ning on muscle hypertrophy and\nisotonic and isometric strength,\nalthough data remain insufﬁ-\ncient for assessing changes in\nmeasures of isokinetic strength,\nand muscle ﬁber and lean body\nmass. The analysis produced\nseveral interesting revelations.\nThe outcomes for strength\nwere somewhat conﬂicting de-\npending on the modality of\ntesting. Heavy loading showed\na clear advantage for gains in\n1RM strength, with probability\nestimates indicating an almost\ncertain likelihood of differences\nFigure 4.

The supe-\nriority of heavy loading for maximal isotonic strength is\nconsistent with the principle of speciﬁcity, which dictates\nthat the more closely a training program replicates the re-\nquirements of a given outcome, the greater the transfer of\nthe training to that outcome (5). Considering the essence of\n1RM testing is to lift maximal loads, it logically follows that\ntraining closer to one’s RM would have the greatest transfer\nto this outcome. Nevertheless, both heavy and light loads\nshowed large effects for 1RM increases (1.69 and 1.32,\nrespectively), translating into mean percentage gains of\n35.4 and 28.0%, respectively. Our ﬁndings therefore indicate\nthat while heavy loads are required to achieve maximal gains\nin isotonic strength, lighter loads promote substantial in-\ncreases in this outcome as well. It should be noted that\nour ﬁndings on the topic are primarily based on untrained\nsubjects as only 3 studies investigated isotonic strength\nchanges between conditions in those with RT experience.\nA subanalysis of training status showed that the direction\nof the interaction was even larger in trained subjects, sug-\ngesting that heavier loading may become increasingly more\nimportant for maximal gains in isotonic strength as one gar-\nners training experience. However, the paucity of data on the\ntopic limits the ability to draw deﬁnitive conclusions.\nWith respect to isometric strength, both high and low\nloads produced similar gains, with minimal differences\ndisplayed in mean percentage changes (22.6 vs. 20.5%,\nrespectively). At face value, this implies that when training\nspeciﬁcity is offset by testing on a neutral instrument,\nincreases in force production can be equally achieved\nregardless of loading zone. However, sensitivity analysis\nshowed that removal of the study by Van Roie et al. (51)\nsubstantially altered the magnitude of the difference between\nconditions, with the 95% CI ( 20.08 to 0.57) showing an\novert advantage to heavier loading. The relatively low num-\nber of studies on the topic limited statistical power to draw\nﬁrm inferences, but examination of the revised CI ( 20.57 to\n0.08) indicates a likely beneﬁt in favor of heavier loading,\nalbeit of a relatively small magnitude (23).\nThere was an insufﬁcient number of studies to quantify\na magnitude of effect on isokinetic strength in high- vs. load-\nlow training. Of the 3 studies that investigated changes in\nthis outcome measure, Aagaard et al. (1) found that only\nthose training with high loads were able to increase isoki-\nnetic strength in a cohort of elite young soccer players. Con-\nversely, Van Roie et al. (51) and Hisaeda et al. (22) reported\nno signiﬁcant differences between conditions in untrained\ncommunity-dwelling elderly adults and young women,\nrespectively. Whether physical activity levels or factors spe-\nciﬁc to these diverse populations contributed to the discrep-\nancies remains to be determined.\nData from direct measures of muscle size indicate similar\nhypertrophic changes between high- and low-load condi-\ntions. Although differences in mean ES ( p = 0.10) suggest\na likely probability favoring heavier load training (23), study\nlevel analysis as illustrated in Figure 4 showed no impact of\nload ( p = 0.56) and the mean percentage gains were com-\nparable between high- and low-load conditions (8.3 vs. 7.0%,\nrespectively). Moreover, sensitivity analysis revealed a num-\nber of studies unduly inﬂuenced results, and the removal of\nthe most inﬂuential studies markedly reduced the probability\nof a difference in mean ES ( p = 0.22–0.46). The ﬁndings\ntherefore indicate that both heavy and light loads can be\nequally effective in promoting muscle growth provided train-\ning is carried out with a high level of effort. Intriguingly,\nemerging research shows a potential ﬁber type–speciﬁc\neffect of loading zones, with heavier loads showing greater\nincreases in type II muscle ﬁber cross-sectional area and\nlighter loads showing greater increases in type I muscle ﬁber\ngrowth (34,35,52). This implies a potential beneﬁt to training\nacross a spectrum of repetitions when to goal is maximize\nhypertrophic adaptations. That said, not all studies have\nfound such an effect (32) and further research is therefore\nneeded to draw relevant practical inferences.\nAlthough not all studies reported attendance during the\ntraining programs, those that did report a high level of\nadherence (i.e., .87% of total training sessions). It has been\nsuggested that low-load training might result in greater dis-\ncomfort compared with high-load training (17). However,\nthe ﬁndings would suggest that both the types of training\nwere equally effective regarding adherence to the training\nprotocols. Furthermore, it would seem that training with\nboth high- and low-load might be equally safe, as only 2\nof the 21 included studies (25,43) reported mild adverse\neffects [i.e., minor tendonitis and 2 minor injuries (1 in each\ngroup), respectively].\nIt should be noted that several studies included in the\nanalysis had potential confounding variables that may have\nimpacted results. In the study by Fink et al. (14), interset rest\nintervals for the low-load condition were 30 seconds,\nwhereas the high-load condition rested 3 minutes. In the\nstudy by Popov et al. (37), the low-load group performed\nrepetitions without relaxation, whereas those in the high-\nload group paused during the isometric portions of the lift.\nRepetition durations in both studies by Tanimoto et al.\n(46,47) were different between conditions, with the low-\nload condition lifting at a tempo of 3s-0s-3s (concentric-\nisometric-eccentric) vs. a 1s-1s-1s tempo in the high-load\ncondition. The extent and direction to which these factors\nmay have inﬂuenced hypertrophic adaptations is not clear.\nPRACTICAL APPLICATIONS\nThe ﬁndings of this meta-analysis can provide speciﬁc\nguidance regarding the prescription of training loads to\npromote increased muscular hypertrophy and strength. With\nrespect to the development of muscular strength, one must\nconsider the needs of the individual ﬁrst and foremost. For\nthose who participate in strength sports, particularly where\nmaximal loads are required in speciﬁc lifts, then training with\nhigh loads on the evaluated lifts is advantageous (principle of\nJournal of Strength and Conditioning Research\nthe TM\n| www.nsca.com\nVOLUME 31 | NUMBER 12 | DECEMBER 2017 |3521\nCopyright © National Strength and Conditioning Association Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\n\nspeciﬁcity). Training with low loads to failure requires exercise\nvolume (work) and time in excess of high-load training,\nsuggesting high-load training may be more efﬁcient. Recently,\nMattocks et al. (28) demonstrated this principle ﬁnding com-\nparable improvements in muscular strength in those who\ncompleted only regular 1RM against a higher volume hyper-\ntrophy program, albeit in untrained participants.\nGiven the robust increases from low-load training on\nmeasures of isotonic and isometric maximal strength, and\nthe similar changes in muscle hypertrophy when compared\nwith heavy loading, there is signiﬁcant ﬂexibility in the\nloading ranges that can be prescribed to promote muscular\nstrength and mass. Emerging evidence indicating ﬁber type–\nspeciﬁc adaptations from training with high vs. low loads\nsuggests a potential beneﬁt to training across a spectrum of\nloading zones when maximizing muscle hypertrophy is the\nprimary goal. This hypothesis warrants further study.\nIt should be noted that all included studies in this analysis\nused momentary muscular failure as the point of set\ntermination. Consequently, application of these ﬁndings to\nRT programming must consider the contribution of concen-\ntric failure to the observed ﬁndings. Although training to\nfailure may not result in superior adaptations than nonfailure\nRT despite increased training volume (39), comparable re-\nsults cannot reasonably be assumed for submaximal, non-\nfailure training based on the present analysis. This\nhighlights the need for further research on the role of effort,\nfatigue, and failure in the relationship between training loads\nand changes in muscular strength and hypertrophy.\nREFERENCES\n1.
