Regular physical activity, specifically aerobic \nand resistance exercises, has been advised in older persons for the prevention of \nchronic dise ases and functional limitations . However, only a limited number of \nstudies have evaluated the impact of concurrent combined training, namely in \nadipokine levels of older adults. The purpose of this thesis was to further explore the \nevidence of the benefit of 8 -month combined aerobic (AT) and resistance exercise \n(RT) in body composition (BC), physical fitness (PF) and adipokine profile of older \ncommunity adults. Furthermore, the secondary aim this study was to investigate the \nrelationships of some adipokines with lipid profile markers and BC parameters in \nolder untrained adults . To achieve these objectives, three st udies were performed: \nThe first was a cross -sectional study with 34 untrained older adults, in order to \ninvestigate the relationship of two adipokines (leptin and adiponectin) with lipid profile \nand BC parameters. The second study aimed to investigate the effects of 8 -month \ncombined AT and RT on BC and PF in the older adults. The third study aimed to \ninvestigate the effect of 8 -month combined AT and RT on plasma levels of five \nadipokines: leptin, resistin, adiponectin, PAI-1 and TNF-α, as well as the lipid profile \nin older adults. \nBased on the analysis of the",
    "results": "of the different studies presented in this thesis, it \nwas possible to conclude that , in older adults, leptin is a body and lean mass \ndependent variable, and adiponectin is a variable dependent o n abdominal fat mass \nand HDL cholesterol. It was also possible to state that 8-month combined AT and RT \nimproves knee flexor isokinetic strength, muscle endurance and lower limb flexibility, \nbut not adipokine plasma levels, lipid profile and glucose plasma levels. \nThis thesis further reinforce that concurrent training seems to be a good strategy to \nincrease muscular strength, endurance, as well as flexibility, and consequently, to \nmaintain functional capacity during aging. Further additional randomized studies with \nlarger samples sizes are needed to evaluate the impact of the combined training in \nthe adipokine profile of older subjects. \n \n\n 13 \nResumo \n \nO envelhecimento está associado a uma diminuição da aptidão cardiorrespiratória e \nmuscular, flexibilidade , e também ao dese nvolvimento de doenças crônicas e \ninflamação crônica do tecido adiposo . A atividade física regular, especificamente \ncom exercícios aeróbios e de resistência, tem sido descrita como um agente \npromotor da saúde e de prevenção de doenças crón icas e de limitações funcionais \nnos idosos. No entanto, apenas um número limitado de estudos avaliou o impacto \ndo treino concorrente combinado, em particular nos níveis de adipocinas em idosos. \nAssim, o objetivo desta tese, foi de explorar o potencial benefício do treinamento \ncombinado de 8 meses com exercício aeróbio (TA) e de resistência (TR) na \ncomposição corporal (CC), aptidão física (ApF) e perfil plasmático de adipocinas, \nalém de investigar as associações de algumas adipocinas com marcadores do perfil \nlipídico e da CC em idosos. Para alcançar ess es objetivos, foram realizados 3 \nestudos: o primeiro foi um estudo transversal com 34 idosos destreinados, cujo \nobjetivo foi investigar as associações de duas adipocinas (leptina e adiponectina) \ncom marcadores do perfil lipídico e com a CC. O segundo estudo teve como objetivo \ninvestigar os efeitos de um treinamento combinado, de 8 meses, TA e de TR, na CC \ne ApF em idosos. O terceiro estudo investigou os efeitos de um treinamento aeróbio \ne de resistência combinados por 8 meses nos níveis plasmáticos de 5 adipocinas: \nleptina, resistina, adiponectina, PAI -1 e TNF - alfa, bem como no perfil lipidico dos \nidosos. \nOs resultados dos diferentes estudos mostraram que nos idosos estudados, a \nleptina foi uma variável dependente da massa corporal e da massa magra, e a \nadiponectina foi uma variável dependente da massa gorda abdominal e d os níveis \nde lipoproteínas de alta densidade (HDL). Também foi possível afirmar que o \ntreinamento combinado melhorou a força isocinética dos flexores do joelho, a \nresistência muscular e a flexibilidade dos membros inferiores dos idosos estudados, \nsem interferir, no entanto, nos níveis plasmáticos das adipocinas, no perfil lipídico e \nna glicemia. \nPodemos concluir que o treinamento concorrente parece ser uma boa estratégia \npara aumentar a força e a resistência muscular, a flexibilidade e, \nconsequentemente, manter a capacidade funcional durante o envelhecimento. Por \nfim, salientamos que outros estudos randomizados com amostras maiores são \nnecessários, a fim de avaliar o impacto do treinamento combinado no perfil \nplasmático de diversas adipocinas. \n\n 14 \n \n\n 15 \nList of abbreviations ACSM: American College of Sport Medicine ADL: activities of daily living AT: aerobic exercise training AHA: American Heart Association  ANOVA: analysis of variance BC: body composition BMD: bone mineral density BMI: body mass index CAD: coronary artery disease CDC: United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CG: control group CHD: coronary heart disease CRP: C-reactive protein CVD: cardiovascular diseases DBP: diastolic blood pressure DEXA: dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry DM: diabetes mellitus EG: experimental group EKG: electrocardiogram ET: endurance training GLM: general linear model HDL-C: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol \n\n 16 \nHF: heart failure HR: heart rate HRV: heart rate variability LDL-C: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol M: mean MLR: multiple linear regression MS: metabolic syndrome O2: Oxygen PA: physical activity PAI-1: plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 PF: physical fitness QoL: quality of life RM: repetition maximum RT: resistance training SBP: systolic blood pressure SD: standard deviation SPSS: Statistical Package for the Social Sciences TC: total cholesterol TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor alpha TRIG: triglycerides VO2max: maximal aerobic capacity / maximal oxygen uptake WHO: World Health Organization \n\n 17 \nChapter 1- General Introduction \n \n\n 18 \nThe dramatic increase in average life expectancy ranks as one of society’s \ngreatest achievements (Explained, 2017a ). The European population is \ngrowing older, a phenomenon extensively eminent and described, with \nsignificant implications for the nation's health, social, and economic \ninstitutions (Explained, 2017b). \nAlthough aging is a multifactorial process that results from the interaction of \nthe primary aging process with the effects of life style, genetics and chronic \ndiseases, age -related functional and structural decline occurs in most \nphysiological systems (Fried et al., 2004 ). This process is associated with a \ndecreased cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, and flexibility (Milanovic et \nal., 2013), and is also associated with the development of chronic diseases, \nsuch as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and obesity (Kennedy et al., \n2014). In this context, functionality and several chronic diseases can have a \nprofound impact on the health and quality of life of older persons (Carvalho, \n2004; Holland GJ, 2002). \nDisability and death associated with chronic diseases and decline in functional \ncapacity might be prevented by regular physical activity. It has been \ndemonstrated that aerobic and resistance training can increase average life \nexpectancy through its influence on chronic disease s development, through \nthe mitigation of age-related biological changes and their associated effects \non health and well -being, and through the preservation of functional capacity \n(American College of Sports et al., 2009). \nCurrent evidence point that aerobic training (AT) mainly improves aerobic \ncapacity and reduces body fat, while resistance training (RT) primarily results \nin increases in muscle strength and mass (Willis et al., 2012 ). Furthermore, \ncombined aerobic and RT may lead to gains in muscular strength (Izquierdo \net al., 2004 ; Wood et al., 2001 ) and cardiovascular fitness (Gudlaugsson et \nal., 2012), as well as improved load -carrying walk performance (Izquierdo et \nal., 2005 ), when compared with either modality alone in older adults. \nHowever, most studies have been performed with combined AT and RT \nalternating schedules, and the effects of exercise programs that combine both \ndimensions in single sessions, known as concurrent training (Lee et al., \n\n 19 \n2015), are still doubting. Thus, this thesis proposes to further explore the body \nof evidence of the potential benefit of combined AT and RT in body \ncomposition and physical performance in older adults. \nFurthermore, aging is also associated with a decline in tissue function and an \nincrease in disease burden, and adipose tissue is no exception. With aging, \nadipose tissue undergoes significant changes in abundance, distribution, \ncellular composition, and endocrine signa lling, and plays a central role in the \ndevelopment of insulin resistance, metabolic dysfunctio n, inflammation, and \nimpaired regenerative capacity with age (Tchkonia et al., 2010 ). The age -\nrelated increased fat mass, especially in the visceral depot, is responsible of \nworsening insulin resistance and glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia , \nhypertension and obesity (Kuk et al., 2009). \nAdipose tissue is now known to express and secrete a variety of bioactive \npeptides, known as adipokines, which act at both the local \n(autocrine/paracrine) and systemic (endocrine) level. The dysregulation of \nthese adipose -tissue derived bioactive molecules is recognized as common \nground for insulin resistance, metaboli c syndrome, atherosclerosis, obesity, \nand aging (Arai et al., 2011 ; Wang & Nakayama, 2010 ). Increasingly, chronic \ninflammation is being linked to aging and chronic disease. \nMoreover, currently there are limited numbers of studies that have evaluated \nthe impact of combined training in adipokine levels of older adults (Beavers, \nBrinkley, et al., 2010 ; Brooks et al., 2007 ; Gondim et al., 2015 ; Jorge et al., \n2011; Ligibel et al., 2009 ; Markofski et al., 2014 ). Generally, t he scarce \nprevious studies demonstrated no benefit of the combined exercise in \nadipokine profile, but they are heterogenous in the length of training time, \nsupervision and had used different methodologies in the training protocol , \nusing, most of them, alternate work week schedules of AT and RT, and not \ncombining both dimensions in single sessions . So, t he second part of this \nthesis further explores the potential benefit of the concurrent aerobic and \nresistance training on the plasma adipokine levels of older adults. \nIn ord er to achieve these objectives , t his thesis was organized into six \n\n 20 \nchapters. The first, second , and third chapters contains, respectively, a brief \nintroduction, background of the theme and the main objectives of the study. \nThe following chapter was devoted to the experimental work , which includes \nthree original studies, submitted to peer-reviewed scientific journals. The final \ntwo topics (chapter 5 and 6) report the final remarks and the main conclusions \nof the thesis. \n \n\n 21 \nChapter 2 -Theoretical Background \n \n\n 22 \nAge-Related Changes and Chronic diseases in older person \n \nIn 2015, t he population of the E uropean Union was estimated to be 508.5 \nmillion. Young people (0 to 14 years old) were 15.6 % of the population, while \npersons considered being of working age (15 to 64 years old) accounted for \n65.6 % of the population and older persons (aged 65 or over) represented \n18.9 % (an increase of 0.4 % compared with the previous year and an \nincrease of 2.3 % compared with the previous 10 years ) (Explained, \n2017a).The median age of the EU -28’s population was 42.4 years on 1 \nJanuary 2015. Between 2005 and 2015 the median age increased in all of the \nEU Member States, rising by more than 4.0 years in Lithuania, Portugal, \nGreece and Germany (Explained, 2017c). \nPopulation ageing is a long-term trend already started several decades ago in \nEurope. Th is trend is visible in the transformations of the age population \npyramid that reflects an increasing proportion of older persons coupled with a \ndeclining proportion of working-age persons in the total population (Explained, \n2017c). Within the last decade (2005 –15), there was an increase of 2.3% of \nthe population aged 65 years or older. The number people ≥ aged 65 years \nworldwide is expected to nearly triple by 2050, with the ‘‘oldest old’’ group (≥ \n85 years) being the most rapidly ex panding segment. In Europe, the median \nlife expectancy increased 3.8 years for women and 2.7 years for men \nbetween 2002 and 2014 (Explained, 2017c). \nAging is a complex process involving many factors that interact with one \nanother, including “primary aging ” process, ‘‘secondary aging’’ effects \n(resulting from chronic disease and lifestyle behaviors), and genetic factor s \n(Weinert & Timiras, 2003 ). This is an involuntary and inevitable process that \ncauses progressive structural and functional loss in the body, such as \ndeterioration of functional capacity, muscle mass and strength los s (mainly \ndue to sarcopenia), loss of bone mass and of hormone production, and delays \nin reaction time, which are risk factors that lead to a loss of autonomy and \nincreased risk of falling (Cederholm et al., 2013; Sherrington et al., 2008). \nA growing challenge is to maintain elderly people independently until end of \nlife. The functional independence is directly in need of physical fitness, i.e. \n‘‘the ability to carry out daily tasks with vigor and alertness, without undue \n\n 23 \nfatigue and with ample energy to enjoy [leisure] and to meet unforeseen \nemergencies”. The physical fitness is determined by several measurable \nhealth-related phenotypes, including , among oth ers, cardiorespiratory fitness \nand muscle function. Among the physiological changes associated with aging, \nthose affecting the cardiorespiratory and vascular system and skeletal \nmuscles are the ones that most affect physical fitness (Garber et al., 2011). \nWith advancing age, structural and functional deterioration occurs in most \nphysiological systems, even in the absence of di scernable disease (Masoro, \n1995). These age -related physiological changes affect a broad range of \ntissues, organ systems, and functions, which, cumulatively, can impact on \nactivities of daily living (ADL) and therefore in the preservation of physical \nindependence in older adults. Besides the decline in maximal aerobic capacity \n(VO2max) and skeletal muscl e performance (Holloszy, 1995 ), changing in \nbody composition is another hallmark , which has profound effects on health \nand physical function among older adults. Specific examples include the \ngradual accumulation of bo dy fat and its redistribution to central and visceral \ndepots during middle age and the loss of muscle during middle and old age, \nwith increased risk of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases (Janssen & \nRoss, 2005; Racette et al., 2006). \nAs population continues to grow and get older , the prevalence of chronic \nillness is likely to increase. Metabolic and cardiovascular diseases are one of \nthe most critical global health threat as they are associated with increased \nmortality and contribute to more than one-third of the global morbidity (Strait & \nLakatta, 2012 ). For older adults, chronic disease is often linked to a higher \nrate of injuries, functional limitations, and cognitive impairments (Fisher & \nMcCabe, 2005 ). Consequently, t he increase in chronic disease rates has \ncreated an eno rmous social, emotional, and economic burden that prevails \nthroughout the world (Yach et al., 2004). \nCardiovascular disease s (CVD) are common in the general population, \naffecting the majority of adults aged 60 years or older. In 2012 and 2013, CVD \nwere estimated to result in 17.3 million deaths worldwide on an annual basis \n(Laslett et al., 2012 ). Despite increases in longevity and decreases in age -\n\n 24 \nspecific death rates from CVD, CVD and its related complications remain \nhighly prevalent (George et al., 2015 ). It’s estimated that a great number of \nthe aged subjects will have morbidity and mortality related to cardiovascular \ndisease, with up to 85% of cardiovascular disease patients over 65 years \n(Pohlel et al., 2006). \nDyslipidemia is a modifiable risk factor for CVD. Aging is associated with \nmultiple, systemic dysfunctions of the body and accompanied by lipid \nmetabolism disorder and chronic inflammatory state, which contribute to \natherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (Perdomo & Henry Dong, 2009 ). \nDyslipidemia is characterized by increased triglyceride and/or low -density \nlipoprotein (LDL) levels, and also declined high -density lipoprotein (HDL) \nlevels. Such an atherogenic lipid profile often predisposes individuals at risk to \ncoronary artery disease with incompletely understood mechanisms (Perdomo \n& Henry Dong, 2009 ). Of particular interest is the fact that plasma levels of \ntotal cholesterol and LDL cholesterol (LDL -C) are well known to increase with \nnormal aging, while HDL cholesterol (HDL -C) is declining with age (Ericsson \net al., 1997 ; Ericsson et al., 1991 ). Elevated plasma LDL -C levels represent \none of the most important risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis \nand subsequent CVD and are in fact a prerequisite for ot her risk factors such \nas smoking, inflammation, diabetes and hypertension. The clustering of above \nfactors has been demonstrated to steadily increase the incidence of \ncardiovascular diseases (Ye et al., 2005 ). The Heart Protection Study (HPS) \n(2002) and the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists meta -analysis demonstrated \nthat a reduction in LDL-C of 1 mmol/L was associated with a 20% reduction in \nclinical cardiovascular events (Cholesterol Treatment Trialists et al., 2010 ). \nThe gender differences in lipid and lipoprotein levels are further affected by \nage. In human observations, the Framingham Study has demonstrated that \naging is associated with a gradual increase in plasma LDL -C levels in men \nand women between 20 and 60 years (Abbott et al., 1983). After the age of 20 \nyears, the plasma LDL -C concentrations increase progressively in me n and \nwomen, but more rapidly in men, accounting for most of the overall gender \ndifferences in cholesterol levels. (Ericsson et al., 1991 ; Ferrara et al., 1997 ). \nHowever, menopause in women often causes an increase in their plasma \n\n 25 \nLDL-C, and after the age of 50, women often have higher total cholesterol \nlevels than men of the same age (Kreisberg & Kasim, 1987). Interestingly, the \nLDL-C levels have a plateau in men between the age of 50 and 60 years, and \nin women between the age of 60 and 70 years (Gobal & Mehta, 2010). \nIt has been well documented that obesity is associated with increased risk for \nmany chronic conditions including coronary heart disease (Tanne et al., \n2005), stroke (Winter et al., 2008 ) and diabetes mellitus (Narayan et al., \n2007), as well as disease risk factors such as hypertension (Sardinha et al., \n2000) and dyslipidemia (Williams et al., 1997). Indeed, the evidence suggests \nthat a central distribution of body fat (subcutaneous or visceral) is much more \nclosely related with an atherogenic metabo lic profile than total body fat \n(Sardinha et al., 2000). Abdominal obesity, the fat around the waist and within \nthe abdominal cavity, may be a critical risk factor for developing these \nmetabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Reduced abdominal fat is an \nimportant feature of the exercise trainin g response and may help to improve \ncardiovascular health, particularly in reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes and \nhypertension (Stewart, 2005). \nAbundant evidence shows that diabetes is an independent and high risk factor \nfor (Grundy et al., 1999 ). Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is a growing problem \nworldwide, because of long life expectancy and life style modifications. In old \nage (≥60 years old), DM is becoming an alarming public health problem in \ndeveloped and even in developing countries as for some authors one from \ntwo old person s are diabetic or pre -diabetic and for others 8 from 10 old \npersons have some dysglycemia (Lozano et al., 2012). The prevalence of \ntype 2 diabetes continues to increase steadily as more people live longer and \ngrow heavier. Older adults with diabetes are at risk of developing a similar \nspectrum of macrovascular and microvascular complications as their younger \ncounterparts with diabetes. In addition, they are at high risk f or functional \ndisabilities (Kirkman et al., 2012). \nGiving the positive effects of exercise on physical function and CVD and \nmetabolic diseases, healthy aging might require an intervention that involves \nregular exercise (Evans, 2002). \n\n 26 \n \n\n 27 \nAging, Physical Fitness and Body Composition \nComponents of Physical Fitness \n \nAerobic Endurance \n \nAerobic endurance means the ability of the cardiopulmonary system to carry \nblood and oxygen to the active muscles and those using oxygen and energy \nsubstrates for a maximum effort (Hawkins & Wiswell, 2003 ).It has been \ndescribed that with increasing age this ability is decreased by a r eduction in \nthe maximum cardiac output and in the capillarization of the skeletal muscle \nmass (Hollmann et al., 2007 ). There are also associated peripheral changes, \nsuch as increased vascular resistance with consequent increase in arterial \nblood pressure and inability to drive blood to the active muscles (Hollmann et \nal., 2007). Further, there are modifications in body composition (decrease in \nlean body mass and increasing fat mass), which can reflect a decrease of \noxygen utilization by skeletal muscle (Fletcher et al., 2001 ). These \nmorphological, physiological and functional changes in the cardiovascular and \nmuscular system drastically limit the cardiovascular capacity contributing to \nthe prevalence of functional limitations , disturbing the ability to perfor m basic \nlife activities (Hurley & Roth, 2000; Toraman et al., 2004). \nThe boundary of the body capacity to take and distribute the oxygen (O 2) and \nexceed the metabolic requirements of prolonged vigorous exercise is \nrepresented by VO2max, defined as the maximum amount of work that can be \ncarried by the body using the oxidative metabolism (Hawkins & Wiswell, 2003; \nSpirduso, 2005 ). This parameter is considered the reference standard for \naerobic capacity and decreases about 5 to 15% per decade after 25 years in \nsedentary individuals and about 5% in active individuals are observed \n(American College of Sports, 1998 ). The VO2max declines in both sexes in a \nsimilar proportion and at around 75 years of age most seniors shows VO 2max \nvalues below the values required for the realization of many of the basic life \nactivities (Hawkins & Wiswell, 2003 ). There is a close relationship between \ndownsizing VO2max and respiratory and/or cardiovascular disease (Spirduso, \n2005). The age decline in VO 2max is accentuated in the presence of chronic \ndiseases (Fleg et al., 2005; Paterson et al., 2007), with significant implications \n\n 28 \nin functional independence and quality of life (QoL) of older persons (Fleg et \nal., 2005). \nIn this sense, it is important to maintain or improve aerobic capacity in the \nelderly, as this ability has direct implications for their mobility, facilitating their \nparticipation in more activities, social contacts, and health (Fleg et al., 2005). \nSeveral studies suggest that the decline in physical performance associated \nwith age can be minimized by regular aerobic endurance training. For \nexample, one study (Evans, 1999) conducted with a 10 to 12 month training \nprogram for elderly with various forms of aerobic activity, and progressive \nVO2max intensity between 60% -75% demonstrated gains of about 15% \nVO2max. Also cross -sectional studies with elderly indicate that more active \nindividuals tend to show higher levels of cardiorespiratory fitness when \ncompared to sedentary individuals (Oja, 2001 ). According to some authors \n(Hawkins & Wiswell, 2003 ; Malbut et al., 2002 ; Westerterp & Meijer, 2001 ), \nthe response of the cardiovascular system to training stimulus remains \nadapted in different age groups, with observed relative increases in VO 2max \nin adults of any age, that are equivalent to those observed in young \nindividuals. \n \nMuscular Strength \n \nMuscle strength is considered a critical component of physical fitness to \nmaintain an optimal driving function and hence a good QoL (Rikli&Jones, \n2001). With aging, there is a reduction in the mass, strength and power of the \nskeletal muscles, resulting in the designated sarcopenia, which translates to a \nloss of muscle quantity and quality (Baker, 2006). This mainly occurs from the \n5th decade, becoming more pronounced after the seventh decade (Rogers & \nEvans, 1993), and is mainly due to the decrease in the number and size of \nmuscle fibers, wi th resulted decreased muscle mass assigned to disuse \n(Pedersen & Saltin, 2006). \nIn addition to the atrophy and hypoplasia with advancing age, several studies \nhave suggested that reductions in neural recruitment capacity mechanism \ncould also contribute significantly to the functional changes observed in the \nelderly (Hoffman & Morcom, 2018). \n\n 29 \nThe decrease in strength is not proportional in all types of muscle groups and \nmuscle contraction (Behm et al., 2002 ; Spirduso, 2005; Vandervoort, 2002). \nDifferent studies in older subjects show that the decrease in strength is more \npronounced in the lower limbs, interfering not only in the ability to execute \ncertain activities such as rising from a chair or bed, but also in maintaining \nposture, gait speed and balance (Carvalho, 2004 ; Hughes et al., 2001 ; \nSchuler et al., 2004 ) leading to increased risk of falls (Kubo et al., 2003 ; \nVandervoort, 2002). \nFurthermore, there is a difference in the dec line of strength according to \ngender, being greater in women than in men. According Spirduso et al. \n(Spirduso, 2005), this difference is mainly explained by hormonal aspects, but \nalso by the higher prevalence of sedentary life style among women. \nThus, in addition to physiological changes previously described, there is \nevidence that environmental factors affect directly the decline in strength with \naging, including low level of physical activity, poor nutrition and chronic \ndisease (Skelton & Beyer, 2003). \nThe development of muscle strength in this age group is fundamental, not \nonly for maintaining an d promoting health, but also to improve the functional \ncapacity and independence of the elderly to perform the basic activities of \ndaily life and hence, improving their QoL (Wong et al., 2003). \n \nFlexibility \n \nFlexibility is an intrinsic property of tissues from the musculoskeletal system \nthat determines the maximum range of motion permitted by a joint or group of \njoints in a given plane, according to an axis without the occurrence of lesions \n(Spirduso, 2005). \nThe loss of flexibility has been associated with aging, with a 20 to 30% \ndecrease around 70 years of age in sedentary individuals (Carlson et al., \n1999). The range of motion throughout life is due to the influence of both \nendogenous factors such as age, sex , biological and physical condition, and \nfrom exogenous factors such as, the duration of training, temperature, degree \nof physical activity, and the presence of fatigue (Holland GJ, 2002). \n\n 30 \nThe decline of flexibility is related to the increased density and stiffness of the \ntendons, ligaments and fascia, particularly due to changes in composition of \ncollagen and elastin and an increase in tissue dehydration (Onder et al., \n2002). In addition to these factors, the decrease in physical activity level with \naging has been associated with a reduc tion in joint amplitude levels, largely \ndue to muscle disuse (Fatouros et al., 2002 ; Spirduso, 2005), to mechanical \nstress and degenerative diseases (American College of Sports, 1998). \nWood et al.(Wood et al., 2005) found that decreased flexibility affects not only \nthe functionality but also the health status of the older person. Low levels of \njoint range not only reduce the amount and nature of the movement \nperformed, but can also incre ase the likelihood of damage in this joint or the \nsurrounding structures, due to loss of balance and joint instability (Fatouros et \nal., 2002; Kerrigan, 2003; Spirduso, 2005). \nIn this sense, it is essential to maintain an adequate level of flexibility in \nelderly, as mobility, functionality and independence of older people impact in \ntheir QoL (Wood et al., 2005). \nCoordination \n \nCoordination is the smooth functioning of multiple body parts when executing \na particular movement. It’s the ability to organize and enable small and large \nmuscle groups to use proper muscle sequence adapted to the task (Spirduso, \n2005). This capability has a progressive decline from 40-45 years through the \ndeterioration of motor representation of changes in the neuromuscular \nsystem, the decrease in visual ability, balance and increased joint stiffness \n(Appell, 1992). \nReduced movement speed, movement composition differences, increased \nvariability, reduced force control, and coordination difficulties are good \nexamples of changes that occur in older adults related to the control of \nmovement (Ketcham et al., 2004 ). As adults age, the execution of movement \nbecomes slower and more variable, affecting the type of ac tivities that older \nadults can efficiently perform and often determine whether they can live \nindependently (Ketcham et al., 2004). \n\n 31 \nOne study suggested that the elderly coordinate their movements similarly to \nthe youth, but controlling them differently, that might be implicated in the \nincreased incidence of falls (Kubo et al., 2003). \nBesides its relation with fall risk, t his ability is very important for the tasks of \nday-to-day, as movements like pushing a coat button, turn on the stove and \neven mobility are dependent on this component. Coordination is a part of most \ntasks of daily living and therefore it is essential to understand breakdowns in \ncontrol and regulation (Scharaeder, 2011). \nAccording to Spirduso et al. (Spirduso, 2005 ) targeted and systematic \nphysical activity can slow the decrease in coordination. \n \nAgility and Balance \n \nAgility can be defined as the ability of the individual to make rapid movements \nwith a change of direction and meaning. This physical quality is closely linked \nto speed, strength, flexibility and coordination. According to Rikli and Jones \n(Rikli&Jones, 2001 ) combined speed (joining speed coordination) and \ndynamic balance (capacity ma intaining postural stability while moving) is \nimportant for a set of tasks that require fast mobility, such as: deviate from the \nroad to avoid being hit by a car or an object , enter and exit the bus in time , or \nget up to quick to answer a call, go to the t oilet or watch a pot on the stove. \nSimilarly, to participate in a set of safety matches recreational / sports elderly \npeople required flexibility and good dynamic balance (Haywood, 2001). The \nbalance information from the visual and somatosensory sensors, the central \nintegration in the brain and the motor response contribute to the dynamic \nbalance (Meyer, 2006). \nThe maintenance and control of posture and balance while standing in static \nor dynamic conditio ns, are essential requirements for independence in \ncarrying out many of the basic activities of life (Pajala et al., 2004 ). Spirduso \net al. (Spirduso, 2005) reported that the balance is not an isolated feature, it \nrequires complex changes in muscle tone and postural control system. \nAny motion, or of a segment of the body as a whole, depends on the balance \n(Pajala et al., 2004 ). The maintenance and control of posture and balance \n\n 32 \nstanding are essential requirements for independence in performing a wide \nrange of activities that develop over a normal day, such as: sit in a chair, \nbathing, crossing the street (Pajala et al., 2004 ). The balance is essential to \navoid falls, which in turn can cause disability, pain and bone fractures, leading \nto immobility (Donat & Ozcan, 2007; Gustafson et al., 2000). \nThe agility and dynamic balance decrease with aging, verifying a steeper \ndecline from the 6th decade, between 60 and 70 decreases by about 20% \nand between 75 and 80 decreases by about 15%. It is estimated that the \nprevalence of complaints in the population over 65 yrs. will reach 85%, which \nmay manifest as imbalance, gait deviation, unsteadiness, nausea and \nfrequent falls (Meyer, 2006; Simocelli, 2003). \nAccording to Rikli and Jones , exercise is an important factor in maintaining \nflexibility and dynamic balance (Rikli&Jones, 2001). Literature has shown that \nphysical exercise practice improves various factors relati ng to balance, \ndeveloping both the proprioceptive sensitivity, decreasing the dependence of \nvisual information and thereby maintaining the quality of balance regulation \n(Gauchard et al., 2001; Gustafson et al., 2000). The interventions used varied \nfrom more g eneralized exercise programs (including aerobic, flexibility and \nstrength exercises) up to exercise that target more specific components of \npostural control system (Skelton, 2001). Mian et al. (Mian et al., 2007 ) stated \nthat the multicomponent programs are more efficient to improve locomotor \nfunction than just one component intervention alone (strength, endurance and \nbalance). \nBalance exercise improves stability and may prevent falls and reduce injuries \nrelated to falls (Sherrington et al., 2004 ). Balance exercises are especially \nimportant for individuals who have a history of falling or who have mobility \nproblems. Research has shown that participation in-group classes such as Tai \nChi improves balance and reduces falls risk (Gillespie et al., 2012). In addition \nto Tai Chi, balance training may involve activities that challenge gai t patterns, \nsuch as heel -to-toe walking; increase awareness of use of the center of \ngravity for basic movements; and augment different sensorial systems \ninvolved in balance maintenance (Gillespie et al., 2012). \n \n\n 33 \nBody Composition \n \nThe term body composition can be divided into two major components: (i) \nlean body mass, which encompasses all non -fatty body tissues, including \nskeletal, water, muscle, connective tissue, organ tissue, and teeth, and (ii) fat \nmass, including the essential fat incorporated into organs and tissues and not \nessential fat in adipose tissue (Heyward, 1996 ). Body composition has a \nstrong genetic component, but is also influenced by environmental factors \nsuch as nutrition, disease and physical activity levels (Spirduso, 2005). \nDespite the decline in weight after the 7 th decade, the fat continu es to \nincrease with age, as lean body mass is progressively replaced by fat (Kyle et \nal., 2001). The distribution of subcutaneous body fat varies according to sex, \nage, body structure and physical activity levels. In women, there is a greater \ninternal fat de posit, while visceral and subcutaneous fat tends to remain \nstable. In humans, peripheral subcutaneous fat decreases with aging , and \nthere is an increased fat deposition in both central and internally (Spirduso, \n2005). \nThe perivisceral obesity increases gradually in men and more rapidl y in \nwomen after menopause, and this is associated with a higher prevalence of \ncardiovascular diseases and mortality (American College of Sports, 2000 ; \nPatterson et al., 2004 ). This difference appears mainly due to hormonal \ndifferences. It is believed that estrogen, a hormone responsible for female \ncharacteristics, has a protective effect on cardiovascular disease, by \nincreasing the levels of High Density Lipoprotein (HDL), reducing the \nappearance of atherosclerotic changes (Fletcher et al., 2013 ; Fletcher et al., \n2001; Spirduso, 2005). \nIncreased visceral fat is considered one of the most important risk factors for \ncardiovascular diseases, diabetes and other metabolic prob lems, because of \nincreased levels of circulating free fatty acids, hyperinsulinemia, insulin \nresistance, increased triglyceride synthesis and secretion of very low density \nlipoprotein (VLDL) by the liver (Ebbert & Jensen, 2013 ). Body mass index \n(BMI; weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) is the most \nwidely used indicator for the assessment of the amount of body fat, despite \nnot being recognized as being the most appropriate in the elderly population \n\n 34 \n(Beaufrere & Morio, 2000; Carvalho, 2006). Because BMI is inversely \nproportional to the square of height, even a small change in height might have \na large effect on BMI. The change in height with age has a substantial and \nincreasing effect on BMI beyond middle age. In the 60 -year period from age \n20 to 80 years, BMI on average will increase by 1.5 kg/m2 for men and 2.5 \nkg/m2 for women, independent of any change in weight (Horber et al., 1997 ). \nTherefore, the tacit assumption that BMI measures the same degree of \nobesity at all ages is incorrect. BMI values increase with age as height \ndecreases, which could lead to a misinterpretation that obesity has increased \n(Horber et al., 1997 ). On the other way, the age-related decline in lean mass \ncontributes to a relative decrease in body weight, without a consequent \nreduction in risk associated with co -morbidities, which are thus \nunderestimated (Heyward, 1996). \nSarcopenia has been recognized as a cause of loss of functional mobility in \nelderly subjects (Evans, 1999 ). However, Visser et al. (Visser et al., 2005 ) \nreported that adiposity is more associated with functional impairment than the \nreduction in musc le mass. For example, according to these authors the \nlimitations imposed by obesity in joint mobility have a greater effect on \nphysical limitations, not comparable with reduced mobility due to decreased \nmuscle mass. Furthermore, it is known that overweight and visceral obesity \nare particularly associated with arterial hypertension, insulin resistance, and \ndyslipidemia, increasing the risk for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular \ndisorders (Patterson et al., 2004). \nFurthermore, there is a prominent role for the decreased body water reserve \nand for the bone loss. Bone mineral density is the result of a dynamic process \nof formation and re absorption of bone and remodeling. The reabsorption \ncauses deterioration of bone tissue while the formation is responsible for the \nreconstruction and strengthening of damaged tissue. This process occurs \nthroughout life in cycles of 4 to 6 months duration. As a result of this dynamic \nprocess, the maximum bone mass is , usually, attained in the third or fourth \ndecade of life (Bouchard, 1993). From there, there is a progressive decline in \nbone mineral density that can progress to osteopenia and osteoporosis \n(Demontiero et al., 2012 ). The amount of water in the body also undergoes \n\n 35 \nchanges as people age, reaching 45% of the total body mass, while in the \nyounger adults water counts as 60% (Sardinha et al., 2000). \n \nAdipose tissue as an endocrine organ \n \nThe traditional view of adipose tissue as a passive reservoir for energy \nstorage is no longer valid. Visceral adipose tissue is more involved in the \ndevelopment of metabolic diseases than subcutaneous adipose tissue \n(Kershaw & Flier, 2004). \nThe major role of subcutaneous and visceral white adipose tissue is to supply \nand store energy via adipocytes. Most of the ingested excess energy is stored \nwithin adipocytes in the form of triglycerides, which are formed through the \nbinding of glycerol and fatty acids (Kershaw & Flier, 2004 ). During exercise, \ncathecolamines (adrenaline and noradrenaline) secreted from the adrenal \nmedulla or the sympathetic nerve terminal break down triglycerides within \nadipocytes, and the resultant fatty acids are carried to skeletal muscle via the \nblood (Sakurai et al., 2013). \nAdipose tissue is now known to express and secrete a variety of bioactive \npeptides, known as adipokines, which act at both the local \n(autocrine/paracrine) and systemic (endocrine) level. Adipokines include \nhormones such as leptin, adiponectin, and inflammatory cytokines, including \ntumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF -α), and plasminogen activator protein (PAI). \nMultiple roles in metabolic and inflammatory responses have been assigned \nto adipokines that firmly established adipose tissue as an endocrine organ \n(Gulcelik et al., 2013). \nThe important endocrine function of adipose tissue is emphasized by the \nadverse metabolic consequences of adipose tissue excess. Obesity, \nparticularly in the visceral compartment, is associated with insulin resistance, \nhyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, hyperten sion, and prothrombotic and pro -\ninflammatory states (Grundy et al., 2004 ). Thus, excess of adip ose tissue \nhave harmful metabolic consequences and represent significant medical and \nsocioeconomic burdens in the world today (Prentice, 2006). \n\n 36 \nPhysiological role of adipokines \nLeptin \n \nLeptin is primarily made in adipose tissue and its circulating levels correlate in \ndirect proportion to adipose tissue mass as well as nutritional status (Gulcelik \net al., 2013 ). Physiologically, leptin is involved in regulating energy balance \nthrough central actions, which is of importance particularly in a con text of fat \naccumulation and metabolic disorders. \nIt is one of the best -known hormone markers for obesity and is very sensitive \nto levels of energy intake, particularly in energy deficient states. Two or three \ndays of fasting can lower human plasma leptin levels even before any loss in \nbody fat mass occurs (Margetic et al., 2002). Leptin deficiency in animals and \nhumans results in in creased food intake, decreased energy expenditure, and \ninfertility (Friedman & Halaas, 1998 ). In spite of the appetite -lowering effects \nof leptin, the majority of obese individuals show hyperleptinemia (Flier, 2004). \nPersistent chronic inflammation and increased level of TNF -α may also play a \nrole in hyperleptinemia of obese individuals as a positive correlation has been \nshown between TNF -α and leptin levels in both human and rodents (Flier, \n2004). \nResistin \n \nResistin, an important cysteine rich adipokine , is  evident in causing insulin \nresistance. Its expression increases during adipocyte differentiation  and the \nprotein levels are high in case of obesity (Steppan et al., 2001 ). It is mainly \nsecreted by inflammatory cells in humans being associated with the presence \nof atherosclerosis (Reilly et al., 2005; Verma et al., 2003). Prospective data on \nthe association between resistin levels and cardiovascular disease events are \nincreasing with conflicting results (Pischon et al., 2005 ; Yaturu et al., 2006 ). \nAlthough a great deal of controversy surrounds its exact biological functions in \nhumans, recent studies suggest that resistin directly causes endothelial \ndysfunction. In clinical studies, resistin has been shown to be a predictive \nfactor for coronary artery disease and cardiovascular disease -related \nmortality. Furthermore, resistin appears to be involved in angiogenesis, \nthrombosis and vascular smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation, all of \n\n 37 \nwhich contribute to atherosclerosis. One previous study within the Health \nAging, and Body Composition Study (Health ABC Study) has shown an \nassociation between resistin levels and heart failure events in the elderly \npopulation (Butler et al., 2009 ). Moreover, a recent meta-analysis including 7 \nstudies reported that circulating resistin levels were associated with mortality, \nespecially in high -risk individuals, such as patients with diabetes (Fontana et \nal., 2015). \n \nAdiponectin \n \nAdiponectin is an adipokine abundantly produced and secreted by adipose \ntissues and widely recognized for its antidiabetic, anti -inflammatory, \nantiatherogenic, and cardioprotective effects , with higher expression in \nsubcutaneous than visceral adipose tissue (Scherer et al., 1995 ). Body \ncomposition changes with ageing can influence the adiponectin concentration. \nIn o lder individuals, age 65 years or more, lower adiponectin levels are \nassociated with higher mortality. Dysregulation of adiponectin in older persons \nmay be due to loss of function of circulating adiponectin or a response to \nincreased inflammatory process (Gulcelik et al., 2013 ). As opposed to other \nadipocytokines, the plasma levels of adiponectin inversely correlates with \nbody mass index (BMI), intra -abdominal fat, and indices of insulin resistance \n(Chandran et al., 2003 ). Plasma levels of adiponectin decrease with weight \ngain and are increased by weight loss (Chandran et al., 2003 ). Several \nstudies confirmed an inverse relationship between insulin resistanc e and type \nII diabetes with plasma adiponectin levels (Chandran et al., 2003 ). \nAdiponectin also reduces the progression of atherosclerosis by decreasing \nthe expression of adhesion molecules, reducing proliferation of vascular \nsmooth muscle, and blocking transformation of macrophages to foam cells \n(Diez & Iglesias, 2003; Kershaw & Flier, 2004). \n \nPlasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) \n \nSeveral proteins of the hemostasis and fibrinolytic system are secreted by \nadipocytes including tissue factor and PAI -1. PAI-1 is a member of the serine \n\n 38 \nprotease inhibitor family and is the primary inhibitor of fibrinolysis by \ninactivating urokinase-type and tissue-type plasminogen activator (Kershaw & \nFlier, 2004 ). PAI -1 has also been implicated in variety of other biological \nprocesses including angiogenesis and atherogenesis (Juhan-Vague e t al., \n2003). PAI-1 expression and secretion are greater in visceral relative to \nsubcutaneus adipose tissue (Juhan-Vague et al., 2003). \nPlasma PAI -1 levels are elevated in obes e and insulin resistance subjects, \nare positively correlated with features of the metabolic syndrome, and predict \nfuture risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (Juhan-Vague et al., \n2003). \nPlasma PAI-1 levels are strongly associated with visceral adiposity, which is \nindependent of other variables including insulin sensitivity, total adipose tissue \nmass, or age (Juhan-Vague et al., 2003 ). Weight loss and improvement in \ninsulin sensitivity due to treatment with metformin or thiazoladinediones \nsignificantly reduce circulating PAI -1 levels (Kershaw & Flier, 2004 ). PAI-1 \nexpression is upregulated by cytokines, namely by TNF-α observed in obesity \nand insulin resistance (Juhan-Vague et al., 2003), \nThe excess of adipose tissue increases the production of PAI -1, leading to an \nimpairment of the fibrinolytic system (Mavri et al., 2001 ). Moreover, obesity is \ncurrently considered a low-grade inflammatory state (Yudkin et al., 2000), and \nis responsible for a series of inflammatory cytokines (in particul ar, IL -6 and \nTNF-α able to induce the PAI-1 overexpression (Kern et al., 1995). \n \nTumor Necrosis Factor (TNF- α) \n \nTNF-α is a cytokine that is mainly produced by monocytes and macrophages \nwith important functions in homeostasis and disease pathogenesis . It is also \nsecreted by other immunogenic cells such as CD4 lymphocytes and natural \nkiller cells and plays major roles in cell death (apoptosis), inflammation, and \ninduction of acute phase reactants (Kern et al., 1995 ). In obese individuals, \nmacrophage-infiltrated visceral fat is the main site of TNF -α production. \nExpression levels of the TNF gene are higher in abdominal adipose tissue \ncompared to subcutaneous fat, and, importantly, greater TNF gene \n\n 39 \nexpression occurs in the adipose tissues of obese animal s and humans (Kern \net al., 1995). \nAccumulating data suggests a direct relationship between TNF -α plasma \nlevels and insulin resistance (Hivert et al., 2008 ; Ruan & Lodish, 2003 ). Also, \nbased on a community-based cohort study, it is proposed that the prevalence \nof insulin resistance increases with greater levels of resistin and TNF -α and is \ninversely related to adiponectin levels (Ruan & Lodish, 2003 ). Diabetic \npatients have high activity of TNF -α in the plasma a nd skeletal muscles \n(Hivert et al., 2008; Kershaw & Flier, 2004; Ruan & Lodish, 2003). \n \nAdipokines and aging \n \nAging is associated with fat redistribution, which is characterized by loss of \nperipheral subcutaneous fat and accumulation of central fat. Individuals with \nexcess adiposity, especially visceral adiposity, have dysregulation of many \nadipokines, including o verproduction of TNF -alfa, IL -6, PAI -1, resistin and \nleptin, as well as downregulation of adiponectin (Arai et al., 2011 ). This leads \nto systemic inflammation and insulin resistance, resulting in cardiovascular \nmorbidity (Ahima, 2009 ). On the other hand, loss of adipose tissue \n(lipodistrophy) with aging also causes adipokine dysregulation and insulin \nresistance (Caso et al., 2013 ). Interesting that experimental eviden ce has \nshown that cellular senescence of adipose tissue also stimulates the \ninflammatory cascade and causes insulin resistance (Minamino et al., 2009 ). \nThese findings suggest that older people are susceptible to adipokine \ndysregulation cau sed by visceral obesity and/or lypodistrophy of peripheral \nsubcutaneous fat, and that adipokine dysregulation is aggravated with \nadvancing age (Arai et al., 2008 ). The redistribution of lipid, particularly \ninfiltration into muscle, is associated with motor impairment and declining of \nphysical function in older adults (Beavers, Beavers, et al., 2013 ). In contrast, \ncentenarians may have healthy functioning adipose tissue that contains few \nmacrophages, and secretes high levels of adiponectin, and low levels of \nleptin, maintaining glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity (Arai et al., \n2011). \n\n 40 \nExercise and Aging \n \nLive an independent and autonomous life, with the ability to carry out the \nbasic tasks of daily life, is a crucial aspect for maintaining quality of life for the \nelderly. However, as stated before, a condition for allowing autonomy of the \nelderly is to maintain their physical fitness and health (Narici & Maffulli, 2010). \nPhysical activity seems to be an important strategy for maintaining autonomy, \nimproving functional capacity, decreasing the risk of non-communicable \nchronic disease and, consequently, improving quality of life (Cerullo et al., \n2012; Narici & Maffulli, 2010). \nThe sedentary lifestyle is a major contributor to the leading causes of death \nworldwide. Physical inactivity speeds up the aging process, whereas \nincreased physical activity slows it down (WHO, 2014). With aging, there is an \nincreased fatigability, muscle weakness and decreased endurance capacity, \nand muscle wasting, leading to decreased physical activity, and eventually to \ndisease (Stewart, 2005 ). Figure 1 shows that, in the other way round, the \ndecreased physical activity also contribute to the decrease in physical fitness \nof older adults (Stewart, 2005). \n\n 41 \nIncreased \nfatigability \nMuscle \nweakness \nDecreased \nendurance \ncapacity \nMuscle \nwasting \nEnergy expenditure \nObesity/abdominal obesity \nInsulin resistance \nGenetics \nDYSLIPIDEMIA \n TYPE 2 \nDIABETES \nHYPERTENSION \nAGING \nDECREASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY \n \nFigure 1. Aging, physical inactivity and disease. \n \nEffect of exercise on physical fitness and health of older persons \n \nPhysical activity in general , and exercise in particular benefits people of all \nages and may decrease all -cause morbidity and increase lifespan ( Table 1) \n(King & Guralnik, 2010 ). In addition to decreased mortality, physical activity \nand exercise are associated with a greater likelihood of healthy aging (survival \nwith better physical and cognitive functioning) (Hamer et al., 2014 ). For older \n\n 42 \nadults, the benefits of increasing physical activity include (Nelson et al., \n2007): improved conditioning and overall physical fitness ; improved mobility \nand reduced onset of mobility-related disability; reduced risk of cardiovascular \ndisease, thromboembolic stroke, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, \nobesity, colon cancer, breast cancer, anxiety, depression, and cognitive \ndecline; reduced likelihood of falls and fall-related injuries; possible decreased \nthe incidence and severity of functional limitations; improved patient outcomes \nin several chronic conditions, including mood disorders, chronic pain, \ncongestive heart failure, stroke, constipation, and sleep disorders. \n \n\n 43 \nTable 1. Evidence for health and physical fitness benefits associated \nwith regular exercise. \nAdapted from King, 2010 (King & Guralnik, 2010). \nAdults and older adults \nStrong evidence \nLower risk of early death \nLower risk of coronary heart disease \nLower risk of stroke \nLower risk of high blood pressure \nLower risk of adverse blood lipid profile \nLower risk of type 2 diabetes \nLower risk of metabolic syndrome \nLower risk of colon cancer \nLower risk of breast cancer \nPrevention of weight gain \nWeight loss, particularly when combined with reduced calorie intake \nImproved cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness \nPrevention of falls \nReduced depression \nBetter cognitive function (for older adults) \nModerate to strong evidence \nBetter functional health (for older adults) \nReduced abdominal obesity \nModerate evidence \nLower risk of hip fracture \nLower risk of lung cancer \nLower risk of endometrial cancer \nWeight maintenance after weight loss \nIncreased bone density \nImproved sleep quality \n \nPhysical activity and exercise also limits the impact of secondary aging \nthrough restoration of functional capacity in previously sedentary older adults. \n\n 44 \nRegular exercise increases average life expectancy through its influence on \nchronic disease development, through the mitigation of age -related biological \nchanges and the ir associated effects on health and well-being, and through \nthe preservation of functional capacity (American College of Sports et al., \n2009). Moreover, some p rophylactic effects of exercise in body composition \nhas been described, namely in minimizing the decrease in bone mineral \ndensity and muscle mass and attenuate the age-related increased in total and \nvisceral fat. \n \nEffect of Exercise on Adipokine levels \n \nExercise, as stated before, is believed to extend lifespan by reducing the \nincidence of cardiovascular and other degenerative diseases and increases \nfunctional performance in older individuals (American College of Sports et al., \n2009). In opposition, an inactive lifestyle leads to the accumulation of visceral \nfat, and this is accompanied by an increased release of adipokines and the \ndevelopment of low -grade systemic inflammatory state. And this low -grade \nsystemic inflammation has, in tur n, been associated with the development of \ncardiovascular diseases and insulin resistance (Gleeson et al., 2011 ). \nExercise has anti -inflammatory effects, and therefore, in the long -term, can \nprotect against the development of chronic diseases (Pedersen & Saltin, \n2006). \nA physically active life -style has a protective effect against chronic \ninflammation associated diseases, such as CVD. This is denominated an anti -\ninflammatory effect of exercise that is mediated by the reduction in visceral fat \nwith a subsequent decreased production and release of inflammatory proteins \n(Gleeson et al., 2011). \nExercise increases energy expenditure and burns off some body fat, reducing \nthe risk of developing obesity and excessive adiposity, however the protective \neffect of a physically active life-style against chronic inflammation -associated \ndiseases may additionally be ascribed to an anti -inflammatory effect of \nexercise. Figure 2 shows selected physiologic effects of some pro-\n\n 45 \ninflammatory and anti -inflammatory adipokines and the effect of exercise on \ntheir blood levels (Golbidi & Laher, 2014). \nFigure 2. Physiologic effects of adipokines and the effect of exercise on \ntheir blood levels (Golbidi & Laher, 2014) \n \n \nMany believe that the beneficial effect of exercise in health is partly mediated \nthrough changes in the adipokines profile, that is, by increasing anti -\ninflammatory cytokines and decreasing pro -inflammatory ones (Petersen & \nPedersen, 2005). For instance, exercise increases insulin sensitivity through \nreduction of resting levels of TNF -α and CRP and augmentation of \nadiponectin levels (Golbidi & Laher, 2014). \nCirculating leptin is correlated to changes in adiposity, and exercise training –\ninduced decreases in adiposity result in decreased circulating leptin in both \nrodents and humans (Bouassida et al., 2010 ). Although this correlation \nbetween adipose tissue mass and leptin has been very well e stablished, the \nrole of exercise training on adipose tissue depot –specific expression of leptin \nis unclear. \n\n\n 46 \nA large body of evidence shows an inverse relationship between plasma \nlevels of pro -inflammatory cytokine TNF -α and exercise training, in several \nstudies in humans and animals (Golbidi & Laher, 2014 ). The association \nbetween the metabolic syndrome and inflammation is well documented \n(Welsh et a l., 2010 ). Controlling the release and activity of TNF -α could \ncontribute to the natural protective effects of physical activity in the metabolic \nsyndrome, as exercise reduces CRP, IL -6, and TNF -α levels and increases \nanti-inflammatory substances such as IL-4 and IL-10 (Fallon et al., 2001). \nThere is not very robust data about the impact of aerobic training in adipokine \nlevels on older persons independent of the we ight loss intervention. Table 2 \ndescribes several studies with adipokines and aerobic training in older \nindividuals. It can be observed that there is no strong evidence for a \nhypothesis that aerobic exercise might decrease leptin, resistin and TNF -α \nlevels, or increase adiponectin levels in older individuals. However, \nimportantly it should be considered that these are small sample size and \nheterogeneous studies, underpowered to drive definitive conclusions. \nTable 2.

There are numerous reports on changes in adipo kine \nconcentrations with diet in obese individuals, but studies that combined weight \nloss intervention with aerobic exercise for older adults are scarce and have no \nconvincing results. These studies demonstrated a decreased (Beavers, \nAmbrosius, et al., 2013 ) or no decreased (Giannopoulou et al., 2005 ) on \nlevels of leptin, and no concomitant changes in adiponectin, resistin, and \nTNF-α levels in obese older adults (Beavers, Ambrosius, et al., 2013; Ryan et \nal., 2003) and postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes (Giannopoulou et \nal., 2005). \nTable 3 describes studies of adipokines in older persons and resistance \ntraining program.

A limited number of studies have \nevaluated the impact of combined resistance and aerobic training in adipokine \nlevels of older adults. Two longitudinal studies have demonstrated increased \nadiponectin levels after 12 and 16 weeks combined resistance and aerobic \ntraining in healthy (Markofski et al., 2014 ) and diabetic (Brooks et al., 2007 ) \nolder subjects. However, currently, studies have not demonstrated a benefit of \n\n 49 \nconcurrent training in leptin (Gondim et al., 2015; Ligibel et al., 2009), resistin \n(Gondim et al., 2015 ; Jorge et al., 2011 ) and TNF-α levels (Beavers, Hsu, et \nal., 2010 ; Gondim et al., 2015 ; Jorge et al., 2011 ). Overall, the described \nresults have not shown that combined training had an impact upon levels of \nadipokines, except for the increased adiponectin levels in two studies (Brooks \net al., 2007; Markofski et al., 2014) and decreased leptin and resistin levels in \nthe overweight and obese groups (Gondim et al., 2015). The heterogeneity of \nthese studies , the small samples sizes and lack of control in dietary intake \nand habitual daily physical activity makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions \nregarding the impact of exercise on adipokine levels. \n \n\n 50 \nTable 4.

Examples of aerobic activities include brisk walking, jogging, \nswimming, water aerobics, tennis, , dancing, bicycle riding, and use of \n\"cardio\" equipment (eg, elliptical machines, stair climbing machines, \nstationary bicycles, and treadmills) (American College of Sports et al., 2009 ). \nGuidelines from the AHA and the ACSM suggest a minimum of 150-\n300min/week of moderate -intensity aerobic activity or a minimum of 75-\n150min/week of vigorous -intensity activity, or some combination of the two \n(American College of Sports et al., 2009 ). The recommended guidelines for \naerobic activities are considered to be in addition to self -care activities \nnormally conducted throughout the day such as cleaning, bathing, walking to \nthe car, or doing errands. Definitions for moderate and vigorous activity \ndepend on the person's baseline conditioning , and are based on a perceived \nrelative exertion of effort (American Colle ge of Sports et al., 2009 ). Regular \nexercise, particularly dynamic exercise of mod erate intensity ( ≤ 70% of \nVO2max or ≤80% of maximum heart rate) involving mostly the aerobic energy \npathway and large muscle mass (e.g., walking, bicycling) attenuates age \ndeclines in cardiorespiratory fitness (American College of Sports et al., 2009 ). \nThis type of exercise, commonly referred as ‘‘aerobic exercise’’ (or \n‘‘endurance exercise’’), has a restoring effect on several important risk factors \nof cardiovascular disease , such as, endothelial dysfunction (DeSouza et al., \n2000; Walsh et al., 2003 ). Importantly, aerobic exercise training has a \nbeneficial dose –response eff ect in at tenuating aging autonomic system \ndysfunction, with trained elderly individuals showing similar baroreflex function \ncompared with their moderately active younger peers (Monahan et al., 2000). \nHeart rate variability (HRV) is a marker of autonomic function and a powerful \npredictor of cardiovascular disease outcome (high HRV is associated with a \nbetter prognosis), and increases with aerobic exercise training in old er people \n(Nolan et al., 2008). \nSupervised aerobic endurance training (AET) programs of sufficient intensity \n(≥60% of pre-training VO2max), frequency (≥3 d/wk), and length (≥16 wk) can \n\n 52 \nsignificantly increase maximal aerobic capacity measured by maximum \nvolume of oxygen (VO2max) in healthy middle -aged and older adults. The \naverage increase in VO 2max reported in well -controlled studies lasting 16 to \n20 weeks is 16.3% when compared with non -exercise control subjects during \nthe same period. Larger improvements in VO 2max are typically observed with \nlonger training periods (20 to 30 wk s.) but not necessarily with higher training \nintensities (Huang, Gibson, et al., 2005 ), unless an interval -type training \nregimen is used (Ahmaidi et al., 1998; Makrides et al., 1990). Significant AET \nincreases in VO 2max have also been reported in healthy subjects older than \n75 years, but the magnitude of improvement is significantly less (Evans, 2000; \nMalbut et al., 2002 ). Although men and women in their 60 ’s and early 70 ’s \nshow similarly relative (% above pre -training) increases in VO 2max after AET \ncompared with younger adults (Spina, 1999). \nThree or more months of moderate -intensity AET elicits several \ncardiovascular adaptations in healthy middle-aged and older adults, which are \nevident at rest and in response to acute dynamic exercise. The most \nconsistently reported adaptations include the f ollowing: 1) a lower heart rate \n(HR) at rest (Huang, Shi, et al., 2005 ) and at any submaximal exercise \nworkload (Hagberg et al., 1989 ); 2) smaller rises in systolic, diastolic, and \nmean blood pressures du ring submaximal exercise (Seals et al., 1984 ); 3) \nimprovements in the vasodilator and O 2 uptake ca pacities of the trained \nmuscle groups (Jubrias et al., 2001 ; Wray et al., 2006 ); and 4) numerous \ncardio protective effects, including reductions in atherogenic risk factors \n(reduced triglyceride and increased HDL concentrations), and reductions in \nlarge elastic artery stiffn ess (Tanaka et al., 2000 ). Moreover, i n studies \ninvolving overweight middle -aged and older adults, moderate -intensity AET \nwithout dietary modification has generally been shown to be effective in \nreducing total body fat (Kay & Fiatarone Singh, 2006; Toth et al., 1999). \nThe ACSM (American College of Sports et al., 2009 ) indicates aerobic \nexercise in older people as an effective strategy to increase functional \nindependence and decrease the prevalence of many diseases associated \nwith aging. Older people who start a training program can expect \n\n 53 \nimprovements in VO2max between 10% and 30%, depending on the intensity \nand duration of training (American College of Sports, 1998 ). Besides the \nimprovements in VO2max with aerobic exercise, when the activity involves the \nuse of rhythmical large muscle groups for longer periods, some studies have \nshown that muscle endurance work also seems to favor the aerobic fitness, \nnot only by increasing muscle mass but also by increasing the capillarity and \nmuscle oxygenation (Spirduso, 2005 ). So, muscular endurance stimulus is \nindicated as an adjunct to endurance work (Kenny et al., 2008). \n \nResistance Training in older persons \n \nSeveral studies have shown that elderly patients may improve muscle \nstrength with training, particularly with resistance training (Hruda et al., 2003 ; \nO'Neill, 2000 ), regardless of high or low frequency and intensity used \n(Izquierdo et al., 2004). \nActivities to maintain and increase muscle strength include weight training, \nweight bearing, or resistance training (RT). Development of muscle strength \nand muscle endurance is progressive and requires gradual increases in \nstrengthening activities over time. Muscle-strengthening activities should be \ndone a minimum of two non-consecutive days of the week and should target 8 \nto 10 major muscle groups (abdomen, bilateral arms, legs, shoulders, and \nhips). There is no recommended time for muscle -strengthening activities; \nindividuals should strive to perform 10 to 15 repetitions of each exercise at a \nmoderate to high level of intensity and gradually increase resistance over time \n(Faigenbaum et al., 2009 ). Training programs, especially if inc luding \nresistance (strength) exercises (i.e., movements, such as weightlifting or \nexercises with resistance bands, performed against a specific external force \nthat is regularly increased during training) are especially useful for improving \nmuscle mass and/ or strength in the elderly (Liu & Latham, 2009 ). In general, \ndata of RT interventions in older persons had a duration ranging from 4 to 48 \nweeks and were in agreement with accepted or ‘‘traditional’’ exercise \nrecommendations for older people, with the usual weekly schedule including \ntwo to three nonconsecutive sessions with one to three sets of 10 –15 \nrepetitions of classic weightlifting exercises, such as leg press (Nelson et al., \n\n 54 \n2007). \nOther effective interventions in old er population include ‘‘high-velocity \nresistance training,’’ i.e., focusing on speed of movement (Earles et al., 2001; \nEvans, 2003 ), or even explosive -type heavy -resistance training, e.g., \nweightlifting exercises with a load equivalent to 75% –80% of one re petition \nmaximum (1RM) and per formed with maximal intentional acceleration of the \ntraining load during the concentric movement phase (Caserotti et al., 2008). In \ngeneral, besides being feasible and well tolerated even by the oldest old, this \nalternative type of intervention would elicit similar (Sayers et al., 2003) or even \nhigher improvements in functional performance and disability compared with \nmore traditional, lower-velocity resistance training (Fielding et al., 2002). \n \nCombined and concurrent training in older persons \n \nA combination of aerobic and resistance activities seems to be more effective \nthan either form of training alone in counteracting the detrimental effects of a \nsedentary lifestyle on the health and functioning of the cardiovascular system \nand skeletal muscles (American College of Sports et al., 2009 ). Regular \ncombined exercise also reduces the risk of chronic metabolic and \ncardiovascular diseases because it exerts anti-inflammatory effects, mediated \nvia both by a reduction in visceral fat mass and the induction of an anti -\ninflammatory environment (Gleeson et al., 2011). \nResistance and aerobic training promote specific neuromuscular and \ncardiovascular adaptations. The muscle hypertrophy and increased motor unit \nrecruitment capacity induced by strength training result in improved muscle \nstrength and power development (Peterson et al., 2010 ). In contrast, aerobic \ntraining induces central and peripheral adaptations that improve the \ncardiovascular function (Cadore et al., 2014 ). The combination of resistance \nand aerobic training in older persons was demonstrated to enhance \nrespectively, by 20%–30% the cardiorespiratory capacity and muscle strength \nin older adults (Huang, Gibson, et al., 2005; Lemmer et al., 2000). \n\n 55 \nHowever, some studies have been shown the “interference effect”, a \nphenomenon that occurs when pairing endurance and strength training \ntogether, one right after the other (concurrent training ) (Chtara et al., 2005 ; \nChtara et al., 2008 ). In this phenomenon, training induces lower strength \ngains when compared to resistance training alone (Docherty & Sporer, 2000). \nWith the l imited number of studies that have investigated the concurrent \ntraining adaptations in older age (Cadore et al., 2012 ; Cadore et al., 2 011; \nIzquierdo et al., 2004 ), it seems relevant to identify the most effective \ncombination of training variables (i.e., volume, intensity, weekly frequency, \nexercise-order), to optimize the concurrent training prescription in older \npersons (Cadore et al., 2014). \nIn",
    "conclusion": ", the advantage of prescribing resistance training simultaneously \nwith aerobic training is related with the improvements of both neuromuscular \nand cardiovascular functions, even when the muscle strength increases at \nlower magnitude when compared with strength training alone (Cadore et al., \n2014). \nThe American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommendations on the \ntypes and amounts of physical activity needed by healthy older adults to \nimprove or maintain health includes both endurance and strength training \n(American College of Sports et al., 2009). According to the United States \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , ACSM and WH O, elderly \nindividuals should perform muscular strength (twice a week or more, with \ninvolvement of most muscle groups) and aerobic activities (at least 150 min of \nmoderate intensity activity or 75 min of vigorous intensity activity, or a \ncombination of these per week) in order to reduce the risk of mortality from all \ncauses, including coronary heart disease, stroke, hypertension, and type 2 \ndiabetes (Organization, 2010 ; States), 2008 ). The WHO presents the \nfollowing summary recommendations for exercise in people aged 65 years \nand older (Organization, 2010): \n• At least 150 min of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, or at least 75 min of \nvigorous-intensity aerobic activity, or an equivalent combination. \n• Aerobic activity should be performed in bouts of at least 10 min duration. \n\n 56 \n• For additional health benefits, undertake up to 300 min of moderate -\nintensity or 150 min of vigorous -intensity aerobic activity, or an equivalent \ncombination. \n• People with poor mobil ity should do balance exercise to prevent falls on 3 \nor more days. \n• Muscle-strengthening activities should be done on two or more days. \n• If older adults are unable to do the recommended amounts of physical \nactivity due to health conditions, they should be as physically active as \nthey are able. \n\n 57 \nReferences \n \nAbbott, R.

Published studies evaluating adiponectin and leptin\nlevels in parallel to lipid profile and body composition demonstrated that plasma levels\nof adipokines are correlated with an atherogenic lipoprotein profile and body fat\ndistribution. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of adiponectin and\nleptin with blood lipids and body composition parameters in older adults.\nMethods and results: The relationship between anthropometrical and body composition\nparameters, adiponectin, leptin, and blood lipids were evaluated in 34 untrained older\nadults. Adiponectin correlated negatively with android fat mass (r = −0.335) and the\npercentage of android fat mass (r = −0.321) from the anthropometrical and body\ncomposition parameters. Adiponectin correlated positively only with HDL cholesterol (r\n= 0.346). Leptin correlated positively with body mass (r = 0.433), BMI (r = 0.666),\npercentage of fat mass (r = 0.847), fat mass (r = 0.806), android fat mass (r = 0.675),\ngynoid fat mass (r = 0.753), percentage of trunk fat (r = 0.846), trunk fat mass (r =\n0.768), percentage of android fat (r = 0.812) and percentage of gynoid fat (r = 0.766)\nfrom the anthropometrical and body composition variables. Only the lean mass was not\ncorrelated with leptin in the body composition parameters.\nConclusion: this study suggests that leptin is influenced by body mass and lean mass,\nand adiponectin is influenced by abdominal fat mass and HDL cholesterol.\nCorresponding Author: Eduardo Arend\nUniversidade do Porto Faculdade de Desporto\nPORTUGAL\nCorresponding Author Secondary\nInformation:\nCorresponding Author's Institution: Universidade do Porto Faculdade de Desporto\nCorresponding Author's Secondary\nInstitution:\nFirst Author: Eduardo Arend\nFirst Author Secondary Information:\nOrder of Authors: Eduardo Arend\nGustavo Silva\nGueibi Souza\nJoana Carvalho\nOrder of Authors Secondary Information:\nAuthor Comments:\nPowered by Editorial Manager® and ProduXion Manager® from Aries Systems Corporation\n\n \nRelationships Between Adiponectin, Leptin, Lipid Profile and Body \nComposition in Older Adults. \n \n \nArend E1,a, Silva G2, Souza G3, Carvalho J1. \n \n \n \n 1 Research Centre in Physical Activity, Health and Leisure, Faculty of Sport, University of Porto, \nPortugal.   \n \n 2 Research Center in Sports Sciences, Health and Human Development (CIDESD), University Institute \nof Maia (ISMAI), Maia, Portugal \n \n 3 Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), Florianópolis, Brazil. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na Corresponding author: Research Centre in Physical Activity, Health and Leisure, Faculty of Sport, \nUniversity of Porto, Portugal.

Published studies evaluating adiponectin and leptin \nlevels in parallel to lipid profile and body composition demonstrated that plasma \nlevels of adipokines are correlated with an atherogenic lipoprotein profil e and \nbody fat distribution. Aim: to investigate the relationshi p of adiponectin and \nleptin with blood lipids and body composition parameters in older adults. \nMethods: The relationship between anthropometrical and body composition \nparameters, adiponectin, leptin, and blood lipids were evaluated in 34 untrained \nolder adults. Results: adiponectin correlated negatively with android fat mass (r \n= −0.335) and the percentage of android fat mass ( r = −0.321) from the \nanthropometrical and body composition parameters. Adiponectin correlated \npositively only with HDL cholesterol (r = 0.346). Leptin correlated positively with \nbody mass (r = 0.433), BMI (r = 0.666), percentage of fat mass (r = 0.847), fat \nmass (r = 0.806), android fat mass ( r = 0.675), gynoid fat mass ( r = 0.753), \npercentage of trunk fat ( r = 0.846), trunk fat mass ( r = 0.768), percentage of \nandroid fat ( r = 0.812) and percentage of gynoid fat ( r = 0.766) from the \nanthropometrical and body composition variables.

Despite \nthe decline in weight after the 7th decade, fat continues to accumulate with age, \nand progressively replaces lean body mass (2). The increased perivisceral \nobesity in men and in wome n after menopause is associated with a higher \nprevalence of and mortality from cardiovascular diseases (3, 4). \nThe a ging process also alters the synthesis, secretion and function of \nadipokines (5). In this context, circulating levels of leptin seems to correlate with \nadipose tissue mass as well as nutritional status. In spite of the appetite -\nlowering effects of leptin, the majority of obese individuals show \nhyperleptinemia (6). Adiponectin is an adipokine with beneficial effects on fat \nmetabolism and insulin sensitivity. It has been shown to improve insulin \nsecretion, insulin sensitivity and fatty acid oxidation, and to have an anti -\ninflammatory influence to prevent atherosclerosis (7). Its concentration seems \nto decreases with weight gain and to increase with weight loss (8). \nCurrently, published studies evaluating adiponectin and leptin levels in parallel \nto lipid profile (7, 9-11) and body composition (9, 12-14) demonstrated the \nplasma levels of these adipokines to be correlated with an atherogenic \nlipoprotein profile and body fat distribution. Particularly, these studies were not \nexclusively focused on older adults. In order to contribute to a better \nunderstanding of the metabolic effects of these cytokines in this population, the \naim of this study was to investigate the relationship of adipokines (adiponectin, \nleptin) with blood lipids and body composition parameters in untrained older \nadults. \n \n2.

Discussion \n \nIn the present cross-sectional study, we analyzed interactions between plasma \nadiponectin and leptin levels with fat and lean indices, and with lipid profiles in \n34 older adults. We demonstrated a positive association between adiponectin \nwith HDL-C. It is know that HDL-C and adiponectin play an important role in \nprotecting against atherosclerosis, by removing cholesterol from atheroma and \ntransporting it back to the liver. In human cell-line models (16), it was suggested \nthat adiponectin might protect against atherosclerosis by increasing HDL -C. \nPark et al ( 2004) demonstrated that decreased adiponectin and increased \nleptin levels are significantly associated with metabolic risk factors for \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n\n \ncardiovascular disease (12). Our results in older adults are in accordance to the \noutcomes from other groups who have also demonstrated that plasma HDL–C \nlevels are positively correlated with plasma adiponectin concentrations in adults \n(9), patients with metabolic syndrome (17), end-stage renal disease (10) and \nolder women with moderate weight loss (13). It has also been demonstrated \nthat adiponectin levels correlate negatively with LDL -C in postmenopausal \nwomen (11); however, our results could not confirm this finding. This might be \nattributed to the low number of individuals, and the inclusion of both genders in \nour population. Our study also failed to control for alcohol intake that might \nincrease adiponectin levels (18). \nLeptin was shown to have a trend to wards a positively correlat ion with \ntriglycerides, in accordance with results from previous studies (11, 13). In our \nstudy, leptin did not dem onstrate a significant association with cholesterol \nlevels. Despite the fact that Rolland et al (11) reported that leptin correlated \npositively with total cholesterol and LDL-C, and negatively with HDL -C, these \nresults are not definitive, and further research in this area is still necessary (19). \nAndroid fat mass is a well-known predictive factor of the amount of visceral fat, \ntherefore establish ing an association between obesity and atherosclerotic \nvascular disease (20). Adiponectin and leptin concentrations are strongly \ninfluenced by vi sceral adipose tissue and by subcutaneous adipose tissue, \nrespectively (12). Our study demonstrated that adiponectin is negatively \nassociated with android fat mass. Other studies also reported that plasma \nadiponectin levels are negatively correlated with visceral fat mass (17, 21), fat \nmass (11), but positivel y correlated with plasma HDL -C (17). Furthermore, \nKumada et al. (22) showed that male patients with hypoadi ponectinemia had \nan increase in coronary artery disease prevalence, independent of well-known \ncardiovascular risk factors. Our study has shown an unexpected result, with a \npositive association between adiponectin and BMI levels , contrary to previous \ndata that have demonstrated a negative correlation with BMI (9). This might be \nattributed to an increased lean mass in detriment of fat mass demonstrated by \ndual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) results in these older subjects. \nAlthough clinical studies show strong relationships between adiponectin and \nleptin levels and body composition indices (7, 9, 12, 14), in general the se \nstudies are limited to anthropometric measurements (BMI and/or waist-to-hip \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n\n \nratio [WHR]) or body fat mass, without using precise methods for detailed \nanalysis of each component, as DEXA used in the present study. In clinical \npractice, the most frequent indicators of obesity are BMI and the WHR , which \nare measured to indicate the nutritional status and used to correlate the risk of \nhealth problems with weight at the population level in adults. Nevertheless, \nthese indicators, although very common and relatively easy to obtain, do not \nallow a precise and unambiguous definition of the relations between individual \nbody components and adipokines. Then, the obtained results highlight the high \nrisk of error in the assessm ent of the relation between adiponectin and l eptin \nlevels and the nutritional status and body fat when only BMI is considered and \nindicate the need to analyze both fat and lean components. \nFor leptin, there are no robust data i n the literature. It has been shown to be \npositively correlated with both fat mass and lean mass (11). O ur study \ndemonstrated that leptin concentration wa s positively correlated with body \nmass, and negatively correlated with lean mass . These data corroborate the \nliterature describing that plasma levels of leptin correlate positively with body \nadiposity, and leptin secretion is many times higher in obese com pared with \nlean subjects (23). \nThis study has several limitations. First, there was a limited number of subjects. \nHowever, our results provide background information on these poorly \nunderstood adipokines in untrained older subjects. Understanding the \nmechanisms associated with leptin and adiponectin level is relevant in the older \npopulation because this transition period is associated with an accelerated \nchange in body composition and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (24, \n25). Second, because of the cross-sectional nature of the study, the causal \nnature of associations between adiponectin or leptin and the different variables \ncould not be addressed. Despite these shortcomings, our study is one the few \nto report the relationship of leptin and adiponectin with lipid profile, body \ncomposition indexes evaluated by gold-standard methods among older adults. \n \nIn summary, this cross-sectional study in untrained older subjects suggests that \nleptin is influenced by body mass and lean mass, and adiponectin is influenced \nby abdominal fat mass and HDL -C.

This study \naimed to evaluate the effects of a concurrent combined endurance (ET) and \nresistance (RT) training in body composition, muscle strength, muscular endurance \nand cardiorespiratory fitness in older adults. Methods: fifty participants were \nassigned into experimental (EG) and control group (CG). Body composition, \ncardiorespiratory fitness, flexibility, muscular endurance, and lower limbs isokinetic \nstrength were assessed at baseline and after 8 months. Training consisted of 30-min \nwalking followed by 45-min RT, 3 times a week. General linear model was employed \ntesting for group x time interactions. Results: significant ( P<0.05) group x time \ninteractions were found for isokinetic strength, with improvement in the EG for: \nright-knee flexion at 180°.s-1 (8.2 ± 2.2 Nm [P=0.017]), left-knee flexion at 60°.s-1 (4.8 \n± 2.7 Nm [P=0.026]), and right-knee flexion at 60°.s-1 (6.0 ± 1.8 Nm [P=0.001]). Group \nx time interaction was also significant for muscular endurance with improvements \nfor EG (5.6 ± 0.8 stands [ P=0.015]), as well as flexibility (2.8 ± 1.9 cm [ P=0.001]). \nConclusion: concurrent 8-month AT and RT improves muscular endurance, lower-\nlimb flexibility and isokinetic strength, but not cardiorespiratory fitness in older \nadults. \n \n \nPage 1 of 22\nHuman Kinetics, 1607 N Market St, Champaign, IL 61825\nJournal of Physical Activity and Health\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\nFor Peer Review\nINTRODUCTION \n \nAging is accompanied by a reduction in lean body mass and an increase in fat mass, \nespecially in the visceral depot, as well as worsening insulin resistance and glucose \ntolerance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension (24). The increase of older population and \ngreater prevalence of frailty have led to growing concerns among healthcare \nprofessionals, seeking strategies to diminish and counteract age-related changes on \nmuscle strength and cardiovascular endurance of older adults (12). In fact, declines \nin maximal aerobic capacity and sarcopenia are examples of functional declines with \naging, which can severely limit physical performance and independence, which \nassociate to mortality (21, 26, 27). \n \nRegular physical training has been shown to prevent age-related losses in muscle \nmass, physical function and several diseases (1). Therefore, international physical \nactivity guidelines for older adults include both endurance (ET) and resistance \ntraining (RT) as means to improve overall health, reduce frailty and increase physical \nfunction (1). Indeed, evidence point that ET mainly improves aerobic capacity and \nreduces body fat, while RT primarily results in increases in muscle strength and mass. \nSeveral studies have been performed to find out the possible synergistic effects of \ncombining endurance and strength training in older adults (3, 9, 32). Furthermore, \ncombined ET and RT may lead to gains in muscular strength (16, 17) and \ncardiovascular fitness (4, 34), as well as improved load-carrying walk performance \n(15), when compared with either modality alone in older adults. \nPage 2 of 22\nHuman Kinetics, 1607 N Market St, Champaign, IL 61825\nJournal of Physical Activity and Health\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\nFor Peer Review\nThese findings suggest that a training program consisting of a combination of \nendurance and strength training may be an effective way to improve overall health \nand fitness in older adults. The inclusion of resistance training (to gain strength, \nhypertrophy, and power) combined with aerobic exercise (to enhance endurance) in \nthe same sessions of a single exercise program is known as concurrent training (33). \nThus, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of a concurrent ET and RT program on \nbody composition, muscle strength and cardiorespiratory fitness in older adults. \n \nMETHODS \nExperimental Approach to the Problem \nThe hypothesis of this study is that endurance combined with resistance training \nmay significantly improve the functional capacity of older adults. \n \nSubjects \nUntrained adults aged 60 years or older were invited to participate in this study. \nVolunteers were recruited from two sources: individuals from the local community \nthat were on a waiting list for physical activity, and through advertisements. \nParticipants completed a health history questionnaire to record past and present \nconditions. By convenience, experimental (EG) and control groups (CG) were \nassigned.

Subjects \nwere weighed barefoot wearing light clothing. Height was measured to the nearest 1 \nmm with a standard stadiometer. Body composition was determined using a Dual-\nenergy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA, Hologic QDR-4500, software for Windows XP, \nversion 12.4) in the supine position. The same investigator analyzed all body scans. \nThe principles behind body composition analyses with DXA are explained elsewhere \n(18). \n \nAssessment of Isokinetic Strength \nDynamic concentric muscle strength was measured through an isokinetic \ndynamometer (BIODEX System 4 Pro; Biodex, Shirley, NY). The main outcome for \nisokinetic strength was peak torque (Nm), assessed in accordance with \nmanufacturer's instructions for knee flexion and extension, at two angular velocities: \n60°.s-1 (1.05 rad .s-1) and 180°.s-1 (3.14 rad .s-1). Each participant, after familiarization \nwith the machine, performed five maximal efforts at 180°.s -1 and three at 60°.s -1 \nwith 2 minutes of rest between tests. The dynamometer angle reading was \ncalibrated to the anatomic joint angle measured by a goniometer, and gravity \ncorrections to torque were based on leg weight at 0° and calculated by the \nequipment software. Prior to testing, subjects performed a 5-minute warm-up on a \nbicycle ergometer (Bike-Max; Tectrix, Irvine, CA) at 45–60 W. During the test, \nparticipants were verbally encouraged to exert maximal force. Peak torque (Nm), \nrepresented as a percentage normalized to body weight, was used for the statistical \nanalyses. \n \nPage 6 of 22\nHuman Kinetics, 1607 N Market St, Champaign, IL 61825\nJournal of Physical Activity and Health\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\nFor Peer Review\nPhysical and Functional Fitness Assessment \nThe Functional Fitness Test Battery consists of 6 items, designed and validated to \nassess the functional parameters that support physical mobility in older adults (25). \nLower body strength was measured using the 30-second chair-stand test. Upper \nbody strength was assessed using the arm-curl test. Lower-body flexibility was \nassessed using the chair sit-and-reach test. Agility/dynamic balance was assessed \nusing the 8-foot up-and-go test. Aerobic endurance was measured using the 6-min \nwalk test that was administrated on a different day. After a demonstration by the \ntester, a practice trial of 2 repetitions, followed by 1 test trial was performed. The \nbest score of 2 trials was used to evaluate performance in the chair sit-and-reach, \nback scratch and 8-foot up-and-go tests. Full detailed information on test \nadministration and protocols can be found in Rikli and Jones (25). \n \nTraining Protocol \nThe EG completed 8 months of a concurrent exercise training program, consisting of \nthree sessions per week, with at least one day of rest between sessions. Each session \nlasted 90 minutes and was conducted by two physical education instructors and \nincluded: (1) a period of a standardized warm-up (5-8 minutes); (2) 30 minutes of ET: \nwalking corresponding to 65-85% HRmax and the target heart rate during exercise \ncontinuously monitored by HR monitors (Polar Vantage XL, Polar Electro Inc., Port \nWashington, NY); 15 minutes of rest, followed by (3) 45 minutes of RT; and (4) a \ncool-down period (5-8 minutes) that included slow walking and stretching exercises. \n The RT protocol aimed to develop muscle mass and strength on variable-resistance \nmachines (Nautilus Sports/Medical Industries, Independence, USA), in the following \nPage 7 of 22\nHuman Kinetics, 1607 N Market St, Champaign, IL 61825\nJournal of Physical Activity and Health\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\nFor Peer Review\nmuscle groups: (1) quadriceps (leg press and leg extension), (2) hamstrings (seated \nleg curl), (3) gluteal (hip abduction), (4) trunk and arms (double chest press, lateral \nraise and overhead press), and (5) abdominal wall (abdominal machine). To minimize \nfatigue, the exercises for the upper/lower parts of the body were performed in a \nnon-consecutive way, with a rest period of approximately 2 minutes between each \nset. Each repetition lasted 3 to 6 seconds, involving a period of 10–12 repetitions at \n60–80% of one repetition maximum tests (1RM). \n \nRT intensity was gradually increased during the first 4 weeks. Participants underwent \na 2-week adaptation period with the equipment and the exercises. The intensity of \nthe training stimulus was initially set at 50% to 60% of 1RM, as determined at week \n2, with a work range of two sets of 10 to 15 repetitions. Subjects then progressed \nfrom 60% to 80% of 1RM at a work range of 6 to 8 repetitions (2 sets) and remained \nat this level until the end of the training program. One repetition maximum tests \nwere performed every 2 weeks for the first month and then every 4 weeks until the \nend of the program. Between these tests, the load was increased for those subjects \nwho were able to easily complete 12 or more repetitions for both sets. \nBoth exercise-training programs were planned for intensities recommended by the \nACSM (11). The CG was proposed to maintain the same daily habits and performed \nthe same evaluation as EG at baseline and at 8 months by the same investigator. \nAfter the experimental protocol, CG was invited to participate in exercise sessions. \n \nStatistical Analyses \nAt baseline, between-group comparisons were performed using Student's \nPage 8 of 22\nHuman Kinetics, 1607 N Market St, Champaign, IL 61825\nJournal of Physical Activity and Health\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\nFor Peer Review\nindependent t-test and the Chi-square test, as appropriate. The effectiveness of the \nconcurrent ET and RT program was analyzed through General Linear Model \n(Repeated-Measures ANOVA with Bonferroni corrections) testing for group x time \ninteractions. When a significant group x time interaction was observed, a Univariate \nGeneral Linear Model was performed to ascertain the differences at the final \nassessment between CG and EG. All General Linear Models analyses were carried \nout with age as a covariate. Partial eta-squared (η 2\np) was reported as the effect-size \nmeasure. All analyses were carried out in SPSS version 21.0 for Mac OSX (SPSS Inc., \nChicago, IL, USA), with a two-sided statistical significance set at 5%. \n \nRESULTS \nAnthropometric and fitness characteristics at baseline are described in Table 2. \nDifferences between groups were found for Peak Torque - Extension - Left – 180 o.s-1 \n(P<0.05), Peak Torque - Extension - Right - 60 o.s-1 (P<0.05), 8-Ft Up & Go, Chair Stand \n(P<0.001), Arm Curl ( P<0.05) and 6-Min Walk ( P<0.001).

This finding was confirmed by a \nsignificant mean difference between groups in the peak torque of the right leg flexion at \n180o.s-1 observed at the final assessment ( P=0.009; η 2\np=0.202). Thus, peak torque of the \nright leg flexion at 180 o.s-1 improved significantly in the EG [27.2 (2.8) N m] compared with \nthe CG [15.0 (3.0) N m]. Likewise, a significant group x time interaction was observed in the \npeak torque of the left leg flexion at 60 o.s-1 ( P=0.026; η 2\np=0.151), a finding that was \nconfirmed by the mean difference between groups in the peak torque of the left leg flexion \nat 60 o.s-1 at the final assessment ( P=0.009; η 2\np=0.201). Thus, peak torque of the left leg \nflexion at 60 o.s-1 also improved significantly in the EG [46.2 (4.0) N m] compared with the CG \n[29.0 (4.3) N m]. Moreover, a significant group x time interaction was observed in the peak \ntorque of the right leg flexion at 60 o.s-1 (P=0.001; η2\np=0.305). This was also confirmed by the \nmean difference between groups in the peak torque of the right leg flexion at 60 o.s-1 at the \nfinal assessment ( P=0.004; η2\np=0.233). Thus, peak torque of the right leg flexion at 60 o.s-1 \nalso improved significantly in the EG [44.5 (3.6) N m] compared to the CG [27.4 (3.8) N m]. \nA significant group x time interaction was observed in the test of lower body muscular \nendurance (chair stand) ( P=0.015; η2\np=0.177), which was confirmed by the mean difference \nbetween groups in the chair stand at the final assessment ( P<0.001; η2\np=0.359). Accordingly, \nchair stand improved significantly in the EG [23.7 (1.2) n° of stands] compared with the CG \n[15.8 (1.3) n° of stands]. \n \nFinally, a significant group x time interaction was observed in the test of flexibility of the \nlower limbs (chair sit & reach) ( P=0.001; η 2\np=0.292). This finding was confirmed by the \nsignificant mean difference between groups in the chair sit & reach observed at the final \nPage 13 of 22\nHuman Kinetics, 1607 N Market St, Champaign, IL 61825\nJournal of Physical Activity and Health\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\nFor Peer Review\nRunning head: EXERCISE IMPROVES FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY \n \n \n14 \n \nassessment (P=0.033; η2\np=0.139). Therefore, chair sit & reach also improved significantly in \nthe EG [0.40 (2.7) cm] compared with the CG [-8.80 (2.8) cm]. \n \nDISCUSSION \nEight-month concurrent ET and RT increased lower-limb strength for knee flexors, muscular \nendurance and flexibility in older adults. However, despite aerobic exercises were in \naccordance with the ACSM recommended guidelines (1, 23), the protocol was not effective \nto improve peak torque of knee extension and cardiorespiratory fitness. \n \nAging is associated with a gradual decrease in strength and muscular endurance (28), with a \nmore rapid decrease after the age of 60 years (29). It has already been demonstrated that \nthe loss of strength in the lower body is faster than in the upper body (13). With decreased \nbody strength, the walking speed and stair climbing ability decrease, and the frequency of \nfalls increases(22). Regular physical activity is an important therapeutic tool for preventing \nmuscle strength loss (7, 8). Our results with long-term combined endurance and resistance \ntraining demonstrated a significant increase of lower-limb strength, especially for peak \ntorque of knee flexors at 60º.s -1 and 180º.s -1. Lee et al (20) also demonstrated that the \nabsolute peak torque in combined endurance and resistance training increased significantly \nmore than it did in the endurance training group. There was a significant increase in the \n60º.s-1 flexion and extension after 8 weeks of training 5 times per week. Two studies with \nshorter period of combined training demonstrated a significant improvement of knee \nextension (9, 14). \n \nPage 14 of 22\nHuman Kinetics, 1607 N Market St, Champaign, IL 61825\nJournal of Physical Activity and Health\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\nFor Peer Review\nRunning head: EXERCISE IMPROVES FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY \n \n \n15 \n \nFerrari et al (2013) (10) did not demonstrate that longer (20 week) concurrent training had a \nsignificant impact in peak torque knee extension at 60º.s -1. In accordance with this previous \nstudy, no significant improvement in knee extension at 60º.s -1 and 180º.s-1 was described in \nour results. \n \nTwo functional ability tests (arm curl and chair stand) that have been validated as measures \nof muscle strength (25) were conducted in the present study to establish the effects of \ncombined training. Our results are similar to those of previous studies that found improved \nchair stand performance (5, 6, 19, 31, 32) with combined training in older adults. Contrary \nto other two previous studies (5, 31) we did not shown a significant improvement in arm-curl \nperformance. \n \nThe flexibility loss with aging is associated with muscle disuse and soft tissue restraints, with \na consequent deterioration of functional abilities in this population (1). This study \ndemonstrated a significant improvement in lower flexibility measured by sit and reach test, \nin accordance with other similar designed study in older adults (5). However, contrary to \nCarvalho et al (2009) (5)there was not a significant improvement in the upper flexibility, \nmeasured by back scratch test. It is interesting to note that in the present study there was \nno specific training for the improvement of flexibility. \n \nCardiorespiratory endurance is defined as the ability to perform dynamic, moderate-to-high \nintensity work using a large muscle mass for an extended period of time (2). Toreman et al \n(31) demonstrated that improved cardiorespiratory fitness seems to be an important \ntherapeutic tool for preventing age-related muscle strength and endurance loss.

Although there was a 31-meter increase in the distance walked in the EG of the \ncurrent study, this difference was not statistical significant from baseline. Carvalho et al (5) \npublished similar results in elderly women, with twice a week and 60 min session combined \ntraining. This lack of improvement in both studies might be explained by the lower \nfrequency and duration of aerobic exercise sessions. According to Gudlaugsson et al (14), 30 \nmin of ET daily with twice-weekly RT seems to be necessary to improve 6MWT performance. \n \nThe strengths of this study are the intensity and the 8-month duration, a control group and a \ncarefully defined and supervised activity by at least 2 health professional guiders. \nFurthermore the assessments by DXA (body composition) and isokinetic dynamometer \n(body strength) were performed at baseline and at the end of the training period. The study \nlimitations included the small sample size and the non-randomized design. The statistical \nprocedures were carried out in order to adjust to group differences at baseline, assuming \ngroup x time interactions main effects as major indicators of the actual effect of the \ncombined exercise training protocol over the dependent variables. Additionally, the effects \nof environmental and behavioral factors are difficult to control during such a long training \nperiod. \n \nFUNDING SOURCE \nThis study was supported by a grant from Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT \nUID/DTP/00617/2013). \n \nPage 16 of 22\nHuman Kinetics, 1607 N Market St, Champaign, IL 61825\nJournal of Physical Activity and Health\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\nFor Peer Review\nRunning head: EXERCISE IMPROVES FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY \n \n \n17 \n \nREFERENCES \n \n1.

Only a few studies have evaluated the impact of \ncombined resistance and aerobic training on the adipokine levels of older \nadults. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of \nconcurrent aerobic and resistance training on the plasma levels of PAI-1, \nTNF-α, resistin, adiponectin, and leptin, as well as the lipid profile in \nolder adults. Thirty-four individuals (n=18 exercise group [EG]; n= 16 \ncontrol group) were included. The EG completed 8 months of a concurrent \naerobic and resistance training program. Exercise did not result in \nsignificant changes in adiponectin, leptin, resistin, and TNF-alpha or \nPAI-1 concentrations. There was a non-significant decrease in total \ncholesterol and triglyceride levels after training. These results suggest \nthat concurrent training do not significantly impact lipid and adipokines \nlevels. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \nMarch 2nd, 2018 \n \nEditor-in-Chief, Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics \n \nDear Dr. Editor \n \nPlease find the enclosed manuscript titled “ Effects of concurrent aerobic and \nresistance training on adipokines and lipid profile in older adults ” for consideration \nfor publication in Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics .

Only a few studies have evaluated the impact of combined \nresistance and aerobic training on the adipokine levels of older adults. The \naim of this study was to investigate the effects of concurrent aerobic and \nresistance training on the plasma levels of PAI-1, TNF-α, resistin, adiponectin, \nand leptin, as well as the lipid profile in older adults. Thirty-four individuals \n(n=18 exercise group [EG]; n= 16 control group) were included. The EG \ncompleted 8 months of a concurrent aerobic and resistance training program. \nThe proposed training did not result in significant changes in adiponectin, \nleptin, resistin, and TNF-alpha or PAI-1 concentrations. There was a non-\nsignificant decrease in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels after training. \nThese results suggest that concurrent training do not significantly impact lipid \nand adipokines levels. \n \nKeywords: adipokines, lipid profile, older adults, concurrent training \n \n \n\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n1. Introduction \n \nAging is a complex process that leads to changes in body composition and \nprofound effects on the health and physical function. There is gradual \naccumulation of body fat and its redistribution to central and visceral depots, \nwith an increased risk of metabolic (Janssen and Ross 2005; Racette and \nothers 2006) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (Kay and Fiatarone Singh \n2006; Singh 2004), the latter remaining a leading cause of morbidity and \nmortality among older adults (Jensen and others 2014). Furthermore, type 2 \ndiabetes (T2D) is also an important age-related chronic disease associated \nwith reduction in skeletal muscle strength and mass and an increase in body \nfat and blood inflammatory markers (Donath and Shoelson 2011). \nThe adipose tissue is an endocrine organ known to express and secrete a \nvariety of bioactive peptides, known as adipokines, such as leptin, \nadiponectin, resistin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and plasminogen \nactivator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), which regulate glucose homeostasis as well \ninflammatory responses (Kershaw and Flier 2004). The aging process alters \nthe function, size, and number of adipose cells, which leads to alterations in \nthe secretion, synthesis, and function of the adipokines (Gulcelik and others \n2013; Reilly and others 2005). \n \nBoth physical activity and exercise training have been proposed as natural \nantioxidant and anti-inflammatory strategies to prevent the evolution and \ncomplications of CVD and T2D (American College of Sports and others 2009). \nThese disorders and physical inactivity have been associated with chronic \nlow-grade systemic inflammation reflected by elevated levels of several \nproinflammatory cytokines (Nicklas and Brinkley 2009; Petersen and \nPedersen 2005). However, literature shows conflicting results about the \npositive benefits from exercise training, something that might be attributed to \ndifferent training protocols (Kelley and Kelley 2006; Monzillo and others \n2003). \nConcurrent training (CT) is a model of exercise prescription that combines \nstrength training and aerobic capacity in the same period of time and that has \nbeen extensively investigated in recent years (Beavers and others 2010; \n\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nGondim and others 2015; Jorge and others 2011; Ligibel and others 2009; \nMarkofski and others 2014). However, a limited number of studies have \nevaluated the impact of combined resistance and aerobic training in adipokine \nlevels of older adults. Two longitudinal studies have demonstrated increased \nadiponectin levels with 12 and 16 weeks of combined resistance and aerobic \ntraining in healthy (Markofski and others 2014) and diabetic (Brooks and \nothers 2007) older subjects. However, studies have not demonstrated a \nbenefit of concurrent training in terms of leptin (Gondim and others 2015; \nLigibel and others 2009), resistin (Gondim and others 2015; Jorge and others \n2011) or TNF-α levels (Beavers and others 2010; Gondim and others 2015; \nJorge and others 2011). The heterogeneity of these studies, the small \nsamples sizes and lack of control in dietary intake and habitual daily physical \nactivity makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding the impact of \nexercise on adipokine levels. The purpose of the present study was to \ninvestigate the effects of concurrent aerobic and resistance training on the \nplasma adipokine levels and the lipid profile in older adults. \n \n2. Material and methods \n \n2.1 Participants and Study Design \n \nThis study was performed at the Faculty of Sports, University of Porto, \nPortugal. Fifty untrained adults aged 60 years or older were invited to \nparticipate through one of two sources: a waiting list for physical activity \noffered to individuals from the local community, and advertisements posted at \nvarious sites in the Porto area. During screening, participants were invited to \ncomplete a health history questionnaire to record past and present conditions \n(Table 1). \nParticipants were non-randomly allocated to an experimental (EG) and a \ncontrol group (CG). Participants were evaluated at baseline and after 8 \nmonths of exercise program with regard to a series of parameters described \nbelow. Exclusion criteria included the following: aged <60 years; being active \nin the previous 12 months (engaging in moderate to vigorous physical \nactivities at least 2 days a week for 20 min or more), any unstable medical \n\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nconditions or contraindication to exercise (e.g., unstable angina, frailty, severe \nrenal or hepatic disease, uncontrolled epilepsy, progressive neurological \ndisease, chronic disabling arthritis, and advanced osteoporosis). Two \nindividuals in each group did not complete baseline assessments. Thirty-four \nsubjects completed the experimental protocol, 18 in the EG and 16 in the CG. \nIn the EG, assiduity at exercise sessions was 94% ± 3%. \nThe nature, benefits, and risks of the study were explained to the volunteers, \nand their written informed consent was obtained before entry into the study. \nThe study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, with \nprior approval from the Ethics Committee and the Scientific Board from the \nFaculty of Sport, University of Porto, for all methods, protocols and \nprocedures. \n \n2.2 Intervention \n \n2.2.1 Experimental Group \n \nThe EG completed 8 months of a concurrent exercise training program, \nconsisting of three sessions per week, with at least one day of rest between \nsessions. \n \nEach session lasted approximately 90 minutes (9:30 AM until 11:00 AM) and \nwas conducted by a physical education instructor with specialization in older \nadults and included: (1) a period of a standardized warm-up (5-8 minutes); (2) \n30 minutes of endurance training (ET), namely walking corresponding to 65-\n85% HRmax (220 - age) with the target heart rate (HR) during exercise being \ncontinuously monitored by HR monitors (Polar Vantage XL, Polar Electro Inc., \nPort Washington, NY); followed by (3) 45 minutes of resistance training (RT); \nand (4) a cool-down period (5-8 minutes) that included slow walking and \nstretching exercises. \nThe RT protocol aimed to develop muscle mass and strength on variable-\nresistance machines (Nautilus Sports/Medical Industries, Independence, \nUSA), in the following muscle groups: (1) quadriceps (leg press and leg \n\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nextension), (2) hamstrings (seated leg curl), (3) gluteal (hip abduction), (4) \ntrunk and arms (double chest press, lateral raise and overhead press), and (5) \nabdominal wall (abdominal machine). To minimize fatigue, the exercises for \nthe upper/lower parts of the body were performed in a non-consecutive way, \nwith a rest period of approximately 2 minutes between each set. Each \nrepetition lasted 3 to 6 seconds, involving a period of 10–12 repetitions at 60–\n80% of one repetition maximum tests (1RM). \nResistance training intensity was gradually increased during the first 4 weeks. \nParticipants underwent a 2-week adaptation period with the equipment and \nthe exercises movements. The intensity of the training stimulus was initially \nset at 50% to 60% of 1RM, as determined at week 2, with a work range of two \nsets of 10 to 15 repetitions. Subjects then progressed from 60% to 80% of \n1RM at a work range of 6 to 8 repetitions (2 sets) and remained at this level \nuntil the end of the training program. One repetition maximum tests were \nperformed every 2 weeks for the first month and then every 4 weeks until the \nend of the program. Between these tests, the load was increased for those \nsubjects who were able to easily complete 15 or more repetitions for both \nsets. \nBoth exercise-training programs were planned for intensities recommended \nby the American College of Sports Medicine (Garber and others 2011). \n \n2.2.2 Control Group \n \nThe CG, not enrolled in the training program, was recommended to maintain \ntheir same daily habits and performed the same evaluation as the EG at \nbaseline and at 8 months by the same investigator. After the 8-month \nobservation period, they were invited to participate in specific exercise \nprograms designed for seniors at the Faculty of Sport. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n2.3 Measurements \n \n2.3.1 Anthropometrics \n \nBody weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg with an electronic weight \nscale (SECA 708). Subjects were weighed barefoot wearing light clothing. \nHeight was measured to the nearest 1 mm with a standard stadiometer. Body \ncomposition (% of Body Fat, Fat Mass and Lean Mass) was determined using \na Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA, Hologic QDR-4500, software for \nWindows XP, version 12.4) with subjects in the supine position. The same \ninvestigator analyzed all body scans. The principles behind body composition \nanalyses with DXA are explained elsewhere (Kelly and others 1998). \n \n2.3.2 Blood Sampling and Biochemichal Analysis \n \nAll blood samples were collected in the early morning (between 7 and 9 AM) \nafter a 12-hour fast at baseline and the 8-month assessment. \nBlood samples were collected in Terumo Venosafe® Serum-Gel tubes. \nSerum was separated within 30 min from blood collection, after centrifugation \nfor 10 min at 400x g. Aliquots of serum were stored at -80ºC until use. \nTotal cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density \nlipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose were measured by a \ncolorimetric assay, using the Olympus Diagnostics AU5400 analyser system \n(Beckman Coulter, USA). \nAdiponectin, PAI-1, leptin, TNF-α, and resistin were measured by a multiplex \nanalysis assay (Millipore, Hamburg, Germany). Briefly, the appropriate \ncytokine standards, controls and plasma samples were diluted in assay buffer \nand added to pre-wet filter plates. Fluorescent beads containing adiponectin, \nPAI-1, leptin, TNF-α, and resistin antibodies were added and incubated on a \nplate shaker overnight, at 4ºC. The wells were washed, and the samples were \nincubated with detection antibodies, for 30 minutes at room temperature and \nwith streptavidin-phycoerythrin, under the same conditions. After washing, \nbeads were resuspended with sheath fluid and analyzed on a Luminex 200TM. \n\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nMean fluorescent intensity data (MFI) were analyzed using the Luminex 100 \nIntegrated System version 2.3 (Luminex Corporation, USA). \n \n2.3.3 Dietary intake \n \nThe dietary intake (expressed in Kcal) assessment was performed by a 3-day \ndietary record (two weekdays and one weekend day) at two time points \n(before and after the intervention). Participants were invited to record and \nweigh all foods and drinks consumed on each recording day, trying to not \nchange their eating habits while keeping the record, and then to bring the \ncompleted records to the research team. Dietary records were analyzed using \nan adapted Portuguese version of the software Food Processor Plus® (ESHA \nResearch Inc, Salem, Oregon, USA), a nutritional analysis software that \nconverts food intake into total energy and nutrients, based on food \ncomposition tables available from the United States Department of Agriculture \nand national data from typical Portuguese foods. \n \n2.4 Statistical Analysis \nAt baseline, between-group comparisons were performed using Student's \nindependent t-test and the Chi-square test, as appropriate. Before analysis, \nlogarithm or square root transformations of the data were performed to \nnormalize skewed distributions. Nevertheless, the data are presented in the \noriginal scale for clarity (Table 2). The effectiveness of the concurrent aerobic \nand resistance-training program was analyzed through General Linear Model \n(Repeated-Measures ANOVA with Bonferroni corrections) testing for group \nversus time interactions. When a significant interaction was observed, a \nUnivariate General Linear Model was performed to ascertain the differences \nat the final assessment between control and experimental groups. All General \nLinear Models analyses were carried out with age as a covariate. Partial eta-\nsquared (η2\np) was reported as the effect-size measure. All analyses were \ncarried out in SPSS version 21.0 for Mac OSX (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), \nwith a two-sided statistical significance set at 5%. \n \n \n\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n3. Results \nIn terms of baseline demographic and clinical features (Table 1), the CG and \nEG differed only with regard to age (P<0.05). Moreover, comparisons \nbetween participants who dropped out and those who completed the study \nrevealed no significant differences in their baseline values (data not shown). \nRegarding anthropometric and biochemistry characteristics at baseline (Table \n2), differences between groups were found for TNF-α (P<0.05).

HDL-cholesterol values significantly decreased post-\nexercise in the EG [7.7±1.2 mg/dL; P < 0.001] with a significant main effect for \ngroup versus time interaction (P=0.014; η2\np=0.181), but no differences in the \nfinal evaluation between groups (P > 0.05). LDL-cholesterol increased by 5.2 \n± 4.2 mg/dL and 10.5 ± 4.5 mg/dL in the EG and CG, respectively. However, \nonly in CG the difference was statistically significant in comparison with \nbaseline (Table 3). \n \n4. Discussion \n \nThe main finding of the present study is that 8 months of a moderate to high \nintensity, concurrent and supervised exercise intervention did not affect the \nlevels of adipokines and glucose, or the lipid profile in older adults. \nWe did not find a decrease in TNF-α levels, in agreement with previous \nstudies with aerobic (Beavers and others 2013; O'Leary and others 2006) or \nresistance training (Bautmans and others 2005; Bruunsgaard and others \n2004; Prestes and others 2009; Reynolds and others 2004) in older adults. \nThe effect of combined long-term training on TNF-α levels was evaluated in a \nrandomized multicenter controlled trial with 424 elderly subjects; in this trial, \nthere was no significant effect of training in TNF-α levels in a sequence of \nsupervised-unsupervised training (Beavers and others 2010). Because TNF-α \nis produced within the adipose tissue (Coppack 2001), we hypothesize that \nthe absence of decreased body fat (body composition) and BMI in our EG \nmight have impacted our results. Also, studies that demonstrated significant \ndecrease in TNF-α levels were conducted in patients with baseline elevated \ninflammatory TNF-α levels (e.g., in heart failure) (Larsen and others 2001; \n\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nLeMaitre and others 2004). Conversely, our population has a heterogeneous \nand less severe comorbidity profile with probable lower baseline levels of \nindividual TNF-α concentrations. Also, it has already been demonstrated that \nexercise may elicit local anti-inflammatory effects that may not be evident in \nthe systemic circulation, such as reduced TNF-α in local skeletal muscle in \npatients with heart failure after exercise training (Gielen and others 2003). \nOur results also suggest that 8 months of concurrent exercise do not improve \nleptin or adiponectin levels in older adults. Results from studies in overweight \nand obese individuals suggest that weight loss, rather than increased physical \nactivity, is the lifestyle factor primarily responsible for improvement in these \nbiomarkers (Beavers and others 2013; Rokling-Andersen and others 2007). \nMoreover, leptin declines after exercise training have been mainly confined to \nthe untrained population (Noland and others 2001). However, our untrained \nolder adults had no significant benefit of concurrent exercise in adiponectin or \nleptin levels. These results were also demonstrated in other studies in older \nadults (Beavers and others 2010; Jorge and others 2011; Ligibel and others \n2009; Markofski and others 2014). Thus, our results may be partly explained \nby the absence of a weight loss intervention protocol, some of which have \nbeen demonstrated to favorably impact adiponectin and leptin levels (Hulver \nand others 2002; Monzillo and others 2003; Rokling-Andersen and others \n2007). Also the observed absence of significant changes in dietary intake \nduring the training period in our study may corroborate these results (data not \nshown). Nonetheless, some previous studies have shown that combined \naerobic and resistance (Gondim and others 2015) or only resistance \n(Fatouros and others 2005) training in older adults has a positive impact on \nadiponectin and leptin levels. The conflicting results among the previously \nmentioned studies on the relationship of leptin and adiponectin levels and \nexercise might also be attributed to the heterogeneity in intensity and duration \nof training protocols. It might be that the 30 minutes of aerobic training in our \nstudy were not long enough to produce a favorable effect in combination with \nthe resistance activity. \nTo our knowledge, this is the first study that examined the effects of long-term \nconcurrent exercise on resistin levels in an older population and reported a \nnon-significant reduction of this hormone after combined exercise. Resistin is \n\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nan adipocyte-released hormone with a physiological association with obesity \nand insulin resistance. Gondim et al demonstrated that resistin levels \ndecrease with 12 months of regular combined training in 143 overweight and \nobese subjects with a median age of 56 years, independently of weight loss \n(Gondim and others 2015). Our study results are in accordance with a study \nin younger diabetic patients (median age of 48), in whom combined training \ndid not change resistin levels (Jorge and others 2011). This effect was also \npreviously demonstrated in other studies with resistance training alone (Jones \nand others 2009; Kanaley and others 2001). Resistance training studies in \ndiabetic patients that combined dietary intervention also did not have an \nimpact on resistin levels (Giannopoulou and others 2005; Monzillo and others \n2003). Thus it is possible that the changes in resistin levels did not achieve \nsignificant results because the present study did not included only overweight, \nobese or diabetic older subjects. \n \nCirculating PAI-1 levels increase with age and are predictive of the incidence \nof acute cardiovascular events in the general population (Cesari and others \n2010; Thogersen and others 1998). In accordance with one previous study in \npost-menopausal women with 6-month concurrent resistance and aerobic \ntraining (Rossi and others 2017), our study did not show significant \ndifferences in PAI-1 levels after training. Epidemiological cross-sectional \nstudies have shown that active middle-aged people have lower fibrinogen and \nPAI-1 levels as compared with non-active persons (Lakka and Salonen 1993; \nSzymanski and Pate 1994). Previous studies suggest beneficial effects of \nisolated aerobic or resistance physical training on fibrinolysis. A 6-month \nintervention randomized study with regular aerobic exercise in 182 sedentary \nand non-sedentary elderly healthy subjects demonstrated a significant \nreduction in PAI-1 antigen concentrations (Schuit and others 1997). Chandler \net al observed a reduction in PAI-1 levels in 25 older healthy subjects \nfollowing a 6-month endurance training program (Chandler and others 1996). \nOur study results might be in part justified by the absence of weight loss \nintervention, as PAI-1 is also secreted by adipose tissue, and previous studies \nput in evidence that a weight loss intervention lifestyle program (Belalcazar \nand others 2011), also when combined with aerobic training (Duggan and \n\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nothers 2016), provided significant reductions in PAI-1 levels in older \nsubjects. It is interesting to note that an association has been found between \nthe acute phase proteins and triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol in an elderly \npopulation (Schuit and others 1997). In our study, the lipid profile levels did \nnot improved, and this might be associated with the absence of decreased \nPAI-1 levels. Indeed, our study did not control for variables such as smoking \nor alcohol consumption before serum measures of PAI-1, and this may have \ninterfered in the observed results. \n \nThe observed impact of concurrent training in the lipid profile was unexpected. \nIn fact, several studies have reported significant positive effects of chronic \nexercise on lipoproteins (Durstine and others 2002; Pedersen and Saltin \n2006). Nevertheless, data from other comprehensive reviews (Durstine and \nothers 2001; Leon and Sanchez 2001) suggest that exercise has little effect \non LDL-C concentrations, and the most consistent effect of physical training \non plasma lipids is the change in plasma concentrations of HDL-cholesterol. \nStudies demonstrated that the effect of exercise (mostly aerobic exercise) on \nlipid profile is frequently combined to and generally attributed to weight loss \n(Poirier and others 1996). Indeed, in our study no significant changes \noccurred in body fat mass and BMI. \n \nThe strengths of this study are the presence of a control group, dietary \nrecording, daily physical activity, duplicated biochemical analysis, and an \naccurate body composition evaluation by DEXA scans. However, some \nlimitations must be acknowledged. The small sample size and absence of \nrandomization limited the power of our analysis and the interpretation of the \nresults. \n \nAlthough our study results provide some insights concerning the effect of an \n8-month program of concurrent aerobic and resistance exercise on \ninflammatory biomarkers, additional studies are needed in older subjects, also \nincluding inflammatory immune-cell chemokines in addition to adipokines \n(Gleeson and others 2011). Endurance and resistance trainings are two \ncommon modalities of physical training. The results show that concurrent \n\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \ntraining, which is a combination of endurance and resistance training, do not \nsignificantly impact lipid and adipokines levels. It seems that the adipokine \nconcentrations could be affected by morphological alterations, given its \npotential connections with body composition, namely fat mass. Future \nmultidisciplinary investigations in older adults should be encouraged in order \nto provide better understanding about the biological and physiological \ngrounding of the different exercise regiments during aging. \n \nAcknowledgments: This work was supported by IPDJ and CIAFEL (FCT grant \nUID/DTP/00617/2013). \n \n \nReferences \n \nAmerican College of Sports, M.; Chodzko-Zajko, W.J.; Proctor, D.N.; Fiatarone \nSingh, M.A.; Minson, C.T.; Nigg, C.R.; Salem, G.J.; Skinner, J.S.

Circulation. 98:2241-2247; 1998 \n \n \n\n 149 \nChapter 5 - Final Remarks \n \n\n 150 \nPublished studies evaluating adiponectin and leptin levels in parallel to lipid \nprofile and body composition (Cnop et al., 2003; Im et al., 2006; Mazzali et al., \n2006; Park et al., 2004 ; Rolland et al., 2006 ; Staiger et al., 2003 ; Zoccali et \nal., 2002) did not focus exclusively in older adults. It has been demonstrated \nthat the plasma levels of these adipokines to be correlated with an \natherogenic lipoprotein profile and body fat distribution (Cnop et al., 2003 ; Im \net al., 2006; Mazzali et al., 2006). The first cross-sectional study of this thesis \n(Study I), included 34 untrained older subjects, and the results suggested that \nleptin levels are positively influenced by body mass and negatively correlated \nwith lean mass , corroborating with data describing that leptin secretion is \nhigher in obese subjects (Proenca et al., 2014 ). As demonstrated in previous \nstudies (Ouchi et al., 2003 ; Rolland et al., 2006 ; Ryo et al., 2004 ), our results \nshowed that adiponectin plasma levels are negatively correlated with \nabdominal fat mass. These results confirmed the ones described in the \nliterature for obese and non -obese adults (Brennan et al., 2007 ; Welsh et al., \n2009). However, we did not expect to demonstrate a positive association \nbetween adiponectin and BMI levels, that might be explained by the finding of \nan increased lean mass in detriment of fat mass in these older subjects. Our \nmethodology had the advantage to include precisely performed DXA \nevaluation in addition to standard anthropometric measurements. \nThe next step of this work was to evaluate the impact of combined training in \nphysical fitness of the se older adults. The I nternational physical activity \nguidelines include both endurance and resistance training for older adults , \nalso as means to reduce frailty and increase physical function (American \nCollege of Sports et al., 2009 ). As stated before, e ndurance training mainly \nimproves aerobic capacity and reduces body fat, while resistance training \nprimarily results in increases in muscle strength and mass (American College \nof Sports et al., 2009 ). The ob jective of the study II was to underline the \nimportance of concurrent endurance and resistance training to improve \nphysical fitness in sedentary older adults . This study demonstrated that eight-\nmonth concurrent endurance and resistant training increased lower -limb \nisokinetic strength for knee flexors, muscular endurance and flexibility in \ncommunity-dwelling older adults. These results are interesting as , so far, few \nstudies have inclu ded exclusively older subjects to address the flexibility and \n\n 151 \nmuscular endurance with concurrent longer term training approach (Carvalho \net al., 2009; Cress et al., 1999; Ferrari et al., 2013; Gudlaugsson et al., 2012). \nOur results with long -term concurrent training demonstrated a significant \nincrease in lower-limb strength, especially for peak torque of knee flexors. Lee \net al (Lee et al., 2015 ) also demonstrated that the absolute peak torque in \nconcurrent training increased significantly more than it did in the aerobic \nisolated training group. The se authors found a significant increase in the \nflexion and extension after 8 weeks of training but 5 times per week. Two \nstudies with shorter period of combined training demonstrated a significant \nimprovement of knee extension (Ferrari et al., 2016 ; Gudlaugsson et al., \n2012). However, in accordance with our results, no significant improvement in \nisokinetic knee extension was noted in the study of Ferrari et al (2013) (Ferrari \net al., 2013) that used longer (20 week) concurrent training with less frequent \nsessions. Probably for this type of contraction in these muscle groups a higher \nfrequent training sessions is required (Lee et al., 2015). \nTwo functional ability tests (arm curl and chair stand) that have been validated \nas measures of muscle strength (Rikli, 1999) were conducted in the present \nstudy to establish the effects of combined training. In accordance to previous \nstudies we demonstrated improved chair stand performance (Carvalho et al., \n2009; Cress et al., 1999 ; King et al., 2000 ; Toraman et al., 2004 ; Wilhelm et \nal., 2014 ) with concurrent training in older adults. Despite no significant \nchanges were observed in isokinetic knee extension muscle strength, \nfunctional improvements were observed after the concurrent training. In fact \nrising from a chair, that involves transferring the body's center of mass from a \nlow position to a high position, is considered one of the mechanically \ndemanding activities executed in everyday life, since it requires not only \nmuscle strength but also dynamic balance (Riley et al., 1991). \nThe flexibility loss with aging is associated with muscle disuse and soft tissue \nrestraints, with a consequent deterioration of functional abilities in this \npopulation (American College of Sports et al., 2009 ). Our study demonstrated \na significant improvement in lower flexibility measured by sit and reach test, in \naccordance with another similarly designed study in older adults (Carvalho et \nal., 2009). However, contrary to Carvalho et al (2009), there was no significant \nimprovement in the upper flexibility (Carvalho et al., 2009 ). It is interesting to \n\n 152 \nnote that in our study there was no specific training for the improvement of \nflexibility. \nMost studies demonstrated that concurrent resistance and aerobic training \nimprove cardiorespiratory fitness measured by 6 -min walk test (Gudlaugsson \net al., 2012; Toraman et al., 2004 ) or VO2 max (Cadore et al., 2012 ; Cadore et \nal., 2011 ; Cress et al., 1999 ; Ferrari et al., 2016 ; Takeshima et al., 2004 ; \nWilhelm et al., 2014 ) in older adults. Although there was a 31-meter increase \nin the distance walked in the EG of the current study, this difference was not \nstatistically significant in comparison with baseline. Carvalho et al (Carvalho et \nal., 2009) published similar results in elderly women, with twice a week and 60 \nmin session combined training. This lack of improvement in both studies might \nbe explained by the lower frequency and duration of aerobic exercise \nsessions. According to Gudlaugsson et al (Gudlaugsson et al., 2012 ), 30 min \nof ET daily with twice -weekly RT seems to be necessary to improve 6MWT \nperformance. \nSince regular exercise can promote cardiovascular health through \nimprovement in the blood lipid profile, by decreasing the concentration of LDL \nparticles and increasing the concentration of protective HDL cholesterol , \nlimiting atherosclerosis (Gleeson et al., 20 11), and also, be recognized as an \nimportant anti -inflammatory effect (Kasapis & Thompson, 2005 ; Pedersen & \nSaltin, 2006) we finally evaluated the impact this exercise intervention in lipid \nprofile and adipokine levels of older adults. \nPrevious studies with aerobic (Beavers, Ambrosius, et al., 2013 ; O'Leary et \nal., 2006 ) or resistance training (Bautmans et al., 2005 ; Bruunsgaard et al., \n2004; Prestes et al., 2009 ; Reynolds et al., 2004 ) in older demonstrated \nimprovement in adipokine profile. However, few studies with concurrent \ncombined training were published so far, with no significant improvements \ndemonstrated (Beavers, Hsu, et al., 2010 ; Brooks et al., 2007 ; Gondim et al., \n2015; Jorge et al., 2011 ; Ligibel et al., 2009 ; Markofski et al., 2014 ). \nTherefore, in study III we intended to evaluate if concurrent combined aerobic \nand resistance training was effective to improve lipid profile and adipokines in \ncommunity older adults . In opposition to our initial hypothesis, with the \nrecognized limitation of the sample size (n=18), our study with long -duration \n\n 153 \n(8-months), high intensity and combined supervised training did not \ndemonstrate a significant decrease in TNFα, leptin, resistin and PAI -1 levels \nor a significant increase in adiponectin levels in older adults. \nIn accordance to previous studies with aerobic (Beavers, Ambrosius, et al., \n2013; O'Leary et al., 2006 ) or resistance training (Bautmans et al., 2005 ; \nBruunsgaard et al., 2004 ; Prestes et al., 2009 ; Reynolds et al., 2004) in older \nadults, combined exercise did not decrease TNF -alfa levels . The effect of \ncombined long-term (12 months) training in TNF -alfa levels was evaluated in \na randomized multicenter controlled trial with 424 elderly subjects. In this trial , \nthere was no significant effect of combined training on TNF -alfa levels \n(Beavers, Hsu, et al., 2010). As in our study, a concurrent approach was also \nperformed, but with a different training protoc ol with supervised-unsupervised \ntraining. Because TNF-alfa is produced within the adipose tissue (Coppack, \n2001), we hypothesized that the absence of decreased body fatness (body \ncomposition) and BMI in the exercise group might have impacted our r esults. \nMoreover, the small sample size and absence of randomization that limited \nthe power of our analysis should be taking into account for the interpretation \nof our data. Also, previous studies that demonstrated significant decrease in \nTNF-alfa levels w ere conducted in patients with baseline elevated \ninflammatory TNF-alfa levels (e.g., heart failure) (Larsen et al., 2001; LeMaitre \net al., 2004 ). Conversely, our population has a heterogeneous and less \nsevere comorbidity profile, where relatively baseline lower levels of individual \nTNF-alfa concentrations might not be excluded. It has also been \ndemonstrated that exercise may elicit local anti -inflammatory effects that may \nnot be evident in the systemic circulation, such as reduction TNF -alfa in local \nskeletal muscle in patients with heart failure after exercise training (Gielen et \nal., 2003). \nMoreover, our results showed that 8 months of combined exercise did not \nimprove leptin and adipokine levels in older adults. Results from studies in \noverweight and obese individuals suggest that weight loss, rather than \nincreased physic al activity, is the lifestyle factor primarily responsible for \nimprovement in these biomarkers (Beavers, Ambrosius, et al., 2013 ; Rokling-\nAndersen et al., 2007 ). According to previous studies, leptin decline after \n\n 154 \nexercise training was mainly confined to an untrained population (Noland et \nal., 2001 ). However, our untrained older adults had no significant benefit of \ncombined exercise in adiponectin and leptin levels . These results were also \ndemonstrated in other studies in older adults (Beavers, Hsu, et al., 2010 ; \nJorge et al., 2011 ; Ligibel et al., 2009 ; Markofski et al., 2014 ). Our r esults \nmight be partly explained by the absence of a weight loss intervention \nprotocol, which has been demonstrated to favorably impact on adiponectin \nand leptin levels (Hulver et al., 2002 ; Monzillo et al., 2003 ; Rokling-Andersen \net al., 2007 ). Also, the observed absence of significant change in dietary \nintake during the training period in our study might corroborate these results. \nNonetheless, some previous studies have shown that combined aerobic and \nresistance (Gondim et al., 2015 ) or specific resistance (Fatouros et al., \n2005)(Fatouros et al., 2005 )(Fatouros et al., 2005 )(Fatouros et al., \n2005)(Fatouros et al., 2005 )(Fatouros et al., 2005 ) training (Fatouros et al., \n2005) in older adults had a positive impact in adiponectin and leptin levels. \nThe conflicting results among all previous mentioned studies on the \nrelationship of leptin and adiponectin le vels and exercise might also be \nattributed to the heterogeneity in intensity and duration of training protocols. It \nmight be that the 30 minutes of aerobic training in our study were not long \nenough to produce a favorable effect in combination with the res istance \nactivity. \nTo our knowledge, this is the first study that examined the effects of long -term \ncombined exercise on resistin levels in an older population and reported a \nnon-significant reduction of this hormone after 8 months of combined \nexercise. Gondim et al demonstrated that resistin levels decrease with 12 -\nmonth regular combined training in 143 overweight and obese subjects with a \nmedian age of 56, independently of the weight loss (Gondim et al., 2015). Our \nstudy results are in accordance with a study in younger diabetic patients \n(median age of 48) where combined training did not change resistin levels \n(Jorge et al., 2011 ). This effect was also previously demonstrated in other \nstudies performed with exclusive resistance training (Jones et al., 2009 ; \nKanaley et al., 2001 ). Resistance training studies in diabetic patients that \ncombined diet ary intervention also did not have impact on resistin levels \n(Giannopoulou e t al., 2005 ; Monzillo et al., 2003 ). It could be that, as this \n\n 155 \nstudy did not included only overweight, obese or diabetic older subjects, the \nchanges in resistin levels did not attain a significant level. \nIn accordance to one previous study in post-menopausal women with 6-month \nconcurrent resistance and aerobic training (Rossi et al., 2017 ), our study did \nnot show significant differences in PAI -1 levels after training . Epidemiological \ncross-sectional studies have shown that active middle -aged people have \nlower fibrinogen and PAI -1 levels as compared with non-active persons \n(Lakka & Salonen, 1993 ; Szymanski & Pate, 1994). Previous studies suggest \nbeneficial effects of isolated aerobic or resistance physical training on \nfibrinolysis. A 6 -month intervention randomized study with reg ular aerobic \nexercise in 182 sedentary and non -sedentary elderly healthy subjects \ndemonstrated a significant reduction in PAI -1 antigen concentrations (Schuit \net al., 1997). Chandler et al, observed a reduction in PAI -1 levels in 25 older \nhealthy subjects following a 6-month endurance training program (Chandler et \nal., 1996). Our results might be in part justified by the absence of weight loss \nintervention, as PAI-1 is also secreted by adipose tissue and previous studies \nput in evidence that a weight loss intervention lifestyle program (Belalcazar et \nal., 2011), provided significant reductions in PAI-1 levels in older subjects. It is \ninteresting to note that an associa tion has been demonstrated between the \nacute phase proteins and triglycerides and HDL -cholesterol in an elderly \npopulation (Schuit et al., 1997 ). In our study , lipid profile levels di d not \nimproved and this might be associated with the absence of decreased PAI -1 \nlevels. Indeed, our study did not control for variables such as smoking or \nalcohol consumption before serum measures of PAI -1 and this could interfere \nin observed results. \nThe impact of concurrent training in lipid profile parameters observed in our \nstudy w as unexpected. In fact, several studies have reported significant \npositive effects of chronic exercise on lipoproteins (Durstine et al., 2002 ; \nPedersen & Sal tin, 2006 ). Nevertheless, data from other comprehensive \nreviews (Durstine et al., 2001 ; Leon & Sanchez, 2001 ) suggest that exercise \nhas little effect on LDL -cholesterol concentrations, and the most c onsistent \neffect of physical training on plasma lipids is the change in plasma \nconcentrations of HDL -cholesterol. Studies demonstrated that the effect of \nexercise (mostly aerobic exercise) on lipid profile is frequently combined to \n\n 156 \nand generally attributed to weight loss (Poirier et al., 1996 ). Indeed, in our \nstudy no significant changes occurred in body fat mass or BMI. \n \n\n 157 \nChapter 6 – Conclusions \n \n\n 158 \nBased on the analysis of the results drawn from different studies presented in \nthis thesis, it is possible to conclude that, in community older adults: \n• Leptin is a dependent variable of body mass and lean mass, and \nadiponectin is a dependent variable of abdominal fat mass and HDL \ncholesterol. \n \n• Eight-month concurrent ET and RT increased lower-limb isokinetic strength \nfor knee flexors, muscular endurance and lower-limb flexibility in older \nadults. \n \n• Eight-month concurrent ET and RT was not effective to improve isokinetic \npeak torque of knee extension and cardiorespiratory fitness. \n \n• Eighth-month combined aerobic and resistance exercise intervention did \nnot affect the levels of adipokines (named as TNF -α, leptin, resistin, PAI-1, \nadiponectin), glucose, and lipid profile in older adults. \n \n\n 159 \nAttachments – \n \nAppendix I – Written informed consent \n \n \n \n \nCarta de Consentimento/ Termo de Responsabilidade \n \nPara a presente investigação, os participantes serão submetidos a uma série de procedimentos de \navaliação de parâmetros relacionados com a aptidão física e a saúde, nomeadamente: \n• Avaliação da composição corporal;  \n• Análises de amostra sanguínea;  \n• Medidas de Pressão Arterial e Frequência Cardíaca em repouso e em exercício; \n• Inquérito sobre estado de saúde percebido;  \n• Inquérito sobre hábitos nutricionais; Avaliação do nível de actividade física habitual;  \n• Testes de Aptidão física (equilíbrio, força muscular e aptidão cardiorespiratória). \nOs dados recolhidos na pesquisa terão fins exclusivamente científicos, a identidade de cada \nparticipante será preservada. Espera-se, que os resultados deste estudo forneçam subsídios para o \nmelhor entendim ento do papel do exercício em algumas variáveis da aptidão física e saúde. Os \nresultados deste estudo estarão à disposição dos participantes mediante a solicitação dos mesmos, ao \nprofessor responsável. Nos casos onde forem detectadas restrições à prática d e exercícios de \nintensidade moderada a vigorosa, serão sugeridos: 1) o afastamento provisório do programa de \nexercício e 2) a procura a um fisioterapeuta para tratamento adequado. Os voluntários têm ainda, o \ndireito de abandonar a pesquisa, a qualquer momento, caso não se sintam satisfeitos. \nEstando informado das intenções e dos propósitos desta pesquisa, \neu,_________________________________________________________declaro que participo \nvoluntariamente nos projectos de doutoramento do Sr. Eduardo Arend, do P rograma de Doutoramento \nem Actividade Física e Saúde da Faculdade de Desporto da Universidade do Porto, com orientação \npela Profa.
