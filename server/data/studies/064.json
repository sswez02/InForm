    "introduction": "Creatine (methylguanidine acetic acid), a metabolite that is synthesized by the body\nand consumed as part of an omnivorous diet, plays an important role in energy\nmetabolism. In the cell, creatine is phosphorylated to generate phosphocreatine\n(PCr), an energy substrate that undergoes dephosphorylation to resynthesize ATP\nfrom adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in the following reaction: PCr + ADP + H\n+ Cr +\nATP. Although creatine was first isolated in 1832 and proposed as an ergogenic\nsupplement in the 1920s (17), the effects of creatine supplementation on perfor-\nmance and body composition were unknown until the early 1990s at which time it\nwas shown that creatine supplementation could increase total muscle creatine and\nPCr (41). Since then, a considerable body of knowledge has come into existence that\nsupports the efficacy of creatine in increasing body mass and performance in high-\nintensity, short-duration exercise tasks. As a result, creatine is currently one of the\nmost popular dietary supplements in the world.\nSeveral well-written reviews have summarized the body of knowledge sur-\nrounding creatine supplementation in a qualitative manner (5, 22, 48, 52, 66, 97,\n115). One recently published meta-analysis of the efficacy of creatine supplementa-\ntion includes a limited number of studies and does not address the areas of aerobic\nmetabolism or body composition (63). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to\nemploy meta-analytic techniques to evaluate the efficacy of creatine supplementa-\ntion on effect size (ES) for various body composition variables and performance\ntasks across the intensity/duration spectrum. Specific questions of interest involved\nES comparison for the following: (a) tasks relying on ATP-PCr versus anaerobic\nglycolysis versus oxidative phosphorylation for energy metabolism, (b) various\nbody composition variables, (c) loading (≤14 days) versus maintenance creatine\nsupplementation (>14 days) regimens, (d) trained versus untrained subjects, (e)\nmale versus female subjects versus groups, including males and females, (f) labora-\ntory-based versus field-based performance tasks, (g) single-bout versus repetitive-\nbout tasks, (h) upper-body versus lower-body versus total-body exercise tasks, and\n(i) sponsored versus non-sponsored research studies.\nMethods\nLiterature Review and Study Selection\nA search of MEDLINE and SPORTDiscus databases in December 2000 revealed,\nrespectively, 336 and 129 citations containing the phrase “creatine supplementa-\ntion”. Abstracts and unpublished theses/dissertations were excluded from this analy-\nsis. The present study includes published English-language, peer-reviewed studies\nthat presented original research data on human subjects. Minimum study criteria for\ninclusion were: (a) randomized group formation, (b) inclusion of a placebo control,\n(c) subjects who were blinded to treatments, and (d) dependent measures of body com-\nposition and/or physical performance with summary statistics (pre-supplementation\nand post-supplementation mean ± SD ) for creatine and placebo treatments. Selected\ndata were recorded from studies meeting inclusionary criteria and coded as de-\nscribed in the following sections.\n→←\n\n200 / Branch\nSubject Populations and Study Designs\nSample sizes were recorded as the total number of subjects (ntotal) as well as the\nnumber of subjects assigned to creatine (ncreatine) and placebo (nplacebo) treatments.\nEach study was classified according to design as randomized double-blind placebo-\ncontrolled (RDBPC), randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover\n(RDBPCX), randomized single-blind placebo-controlled (RSBPC), or single-group\nrepeated-measures (SGRM). Demographic data included age (yrs) and subject gen-\nder (male, female, or combined [males and females]). The classification of trained\nstate was based solely on the population description. Subjects described as “healthy,\nphysically active” were considered to be trained.\nCreatine Supplementation and Muscle Absorption\nCreatine loading (≤14 d) and maintenance (>14 d) supplementation data included\ndosage (g/d), length (d), and creatine ingested (g) during both phases. Studies were\nalso classified as to whether measurement of muscle [creatine] was included in the\nmethodology (yes or no). If yes, the measurement method (i.e., biopsy, \n31P-magnetic\nresonance spectroscopy [31P-MRS], or measurement of plasma and urine [creatine]\nand [creatinine]) was also recorded.\nPerformance Tasks\nPerformance modes were classified into one of the following 11 categories: arm\nergometry (AE), bicycle ergometry (BE), isokinetic torque production (IK), iso-\nmetric force production (IM), isotonic strength/endurance (IT), jumping perfor-\nmance (JP), kayaking performance (KY), running performance (RN), rowing per-\nformance (RW), ice-skating performance (SK), and swimming performance (SW).\nPrimary Energy System for Performance Tasks\nThe following classification was used to categorize the primary energy system for a\ngiven performance task. The ATP-PCr energy system was designated as the primary\nenergy system for discrete high-intensity performance tasks of ≤ 30 s in duration.\nAnaerobic glycolysis was considered as the primary energy system for high-inten-\nsity tasks > 30 to ≤ 150 s in duration. Tasks > 150 s in duration were considered as\nrelying primarily on oxidative phosphorylation. This classification system has been\nused in a previous review of creatine supplementation (115).\nDescription of Performance Task or Body Composition Variables\nA description of the performance task included the type of task and the measured\nvariable (e.g., power in W, energy in kJ, work in Nm, repetitions, mass lifted in kg).\nRunning, jumping, swimming, and skating were classified as field-based perfor-\nmance tasks. Arm and leg ergometry, isokinetic, isometric, isotonic tasks, and\nsimulated rowing and kayaking were classified as laboratory-based tasks. Perfor-\nmance tasks were also classified as single-bout or repetitive-bout exercise. The first\nbout of repetitive-bout exercise was classified as a single-bout exercise task. Re-\nported body composition variables were primarily total body mass, lean body mass,\nfat mass, and estimated body fat percentage.\n\nCreatine Supplementation: A Meta-analysis / 201\nPre-supplementation and Post-supplementation Values\nPre-supplementation and post-supplementation means and standard deviations\n(mean ± SD ) for creatine and placebo groups or treatments were obtained from the\noriginal data for dependent variables. Standard errors (SE) were converted to stan-\ndard deviations (SD ) as follows: SD = SE · √n, where n was the group sample size.\nData originally reported in graphical form were converted to numeric values with\nthe use of a millimeter ruler. Briefly, a conversion factor was determined from the y-\naxis scale (i.e., a units / b mm). The distance (d) from the top of the bar or middle of\nthe data point to the smallest y-axis value was then measured. Finally, the mean\nvalue was calculated as [(a/b) · d]. In cases where the graph origin did not have a y-\naxis coordinate of 0, the smallest y-axis value used to calculate a was added to the\nabove calculation. The same factor was used to convert error bars (SD or SE) to a\nnumeric SD value.\nPercent Change From Baseline\nThe relative (%) change from baseline following supplementation was calculated\nfor placebo and creatine treatments as [(mean\npost – meanpre) / meanpre · 100].\nStatistical Significance and Manufacturer Involvement\nThe statistical significance of creatine in improving the performance task or body\ncomposition variable was coded as yes (significant) or no (non-significant). Manu-\nfacturer sponsorship/involvement or any financial support of the study was coded as\nyes or no based on information in the acknowledgment sections of the reviewed\nstudies.\nEffect Size (ES) of Creatine Supplementation\nThe ES of creatine supplementation for each dependent variable was calculated\nusing procedures described by Thomas and French (100). Briefly, ES was calcu-\nlated as follows: ES = [(mean\nCr-post – meanPl-post) / sp], where (meanCr-post – meanPl-post)\nequaled the difference between the mean values for the creatine and placebo groups\nfollowing supplementation, and sp equaled the pooled standard deviation of the two\ngroups. Each ES was then corrected (EScorr) to adjust for any positive bias due to\nsmall samples. The variance of each individual ES was also calculated. The absolute\nvalue of ES was reported for tasks in which a smaller value is associated with\nimproved performance (e.g., running, rowing, skating, swimming). Therefore, a\npositive ES denotes improved performance.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe effect of various categorical independent variables on ES was analyzed by\nindependent t test or ANOVA using SAS for Windows 8.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,\nNC, USA). Associations between selected variables were examined by chi-square\ntest of independence or Pearson correlation coefficient. The criterion for signifi-\ncance for all analyses was α = 0.05. Unless otherwise indicated, all data are mean ±\nSE.\n\n202 / Branch\nResults\nGeneral Study Characteristics\nNinety-six published investigations (100 studies) totaling 1,847 subjects met the\nstudy design criteria for inclusion in this analysis. These studies are listed in Table 1.\nThe average sample size was 19 ± 1, with a range of 4 to 80 subjects. Study design\ncharacteristics are presented in Table 2. Briefly, most (93%) of the research on\ncreatine supplementation has come into existence since 1994. Most (71%) studies\nare randomized, double-blind, placebo-control investigations of the effects of an\nacute (19.7 ± 0.5 g/d for 9 ± 1 d) creatine loading regimen on young (26 ± 1.1 years),\ntrained (77%) males (68%). Twenty-four (24%) studies included males and females\nas subjects. The effect of creatine supplementation on females was the focus of only\n9 (9%) studies. Only 22 (22%) studies investigated the effects of low-dose mainte-\nnance following acute creatine loading. Few studies measured muscle absorption of\nsupplemented creatine. Methodologies used in studies that measured creatine ab-\nsorption included needle biopsy (n = 10, 10%), \n31P-MRS (n = 10, 10%), or measure-\nment of urinary/plasma [creatine] and [creatinine] (n = 7, 7%). There was no asso-\nciation between manufacturer involvement (acknowledgment of manufacturer = s\nsupport or other financial assistance) and reporting at least one significant finding\nfollowing creatine supplementation (χ2 = 2.23, p = .135; Table 2). Furthermore,\nthere was no ES difference between studies in which there was acknowledgment of\nmanufacturer’s support or other financial assistance and studies where no such\nsupport was indicated (0.224 ± 0.03 vs. 0.21 ± 0.02, p = .68).\nStudies Excluded From the Meta-analysis\nSeveral studies that are listed in Table 3 reported only change from baseline (∆) or\npercent change (%∆) following supplementation (34, 35, 53, 54, 76, 106–108, 110).\nSince pre-supplementation and post-supplementation means and standard devia-\ntions of dependent variables for placebo and creatine treatments are required to\ncorrectly calculate effect size as well as the percent change from baseline (%∆), the\nfollowing results exclude dependent variables (n = 83) from these studies for which\nonly the change from baseline (∆ or %∆) was reported.\nOverall ES Following Creatine Supplementation\nThe ES frequency distribution for all body composition and performance variables\nwas approximately normal (Figure 1), with positive skewness revealed in the nor-\nmal probability and box-and-whiskers plots (not shown). The exclusion of ES val-\nues greater than 1.72 (n = 10) and less than –1.28 (n = 2) resulted in a distribution\nwith a range of approximately six standard deviation units, but the statistical analy-\nsis for this subset was no different than the analysis for the entire distribution.\nTherefore, unless otherwise indicated, the following results include outliers (n =\n984). A small but significant ES (0.22 ± 0.02, 95%CI = 0.19, 0.25, p < .0001) was\nobserved across all body composition and performance variables following creatine\nsupplementation. The mean change in these variables from baseline following cre-\natine supplementation (5.7 ± 0.5%, 95%CI = 4.7, 6.6%) was significantly greater\n(p < .0001) than that observed following placebo supplementation (2.4 ± 0.4%,\n95%CI = 1.6, 3.2%).\n\nCreatine Supplementation: A Meta-analysis / 203\nTable 1 Summary of Studies Used in the Meta-analysis of the Ef\nficacy of Creatine Supplementation

and post-supplementation\nmuscle [total creatine] by biopsy also included performance tasks (6, 16, 29, 33, 60,\n90, 112). The association between baseline muscle [total creatine] (124.6 ± 2.5\nmmol/kg) and percent change in muscle [total creatine] (18.1 ± 1.8%) was not\nsignificant (n = 7, r = –0.62, p = .135). Performance ES (n = 75) was not associated\nwith pre-supplementation muscle [total creatine] (r = 0.09, p = .44) or percent\nchange in muscle [total creatine] (r = –0.01, p = .95). A categorical “response to\ncreatine supplementation” variable was created using the median increase in muscle\n[total creatine] (22.8 mmol/kg) in these seven studies. The percentage of significant\neffect sizes following a creatine uptake of > 22.8 mmol/kg was greater than that\nobserved following creatine uptake of lower magnitude (36.4 vs. 7.6%, χ\n2 = 9.6, p <\n.002). However, there was no observed effect (p = .56) of this variable on perfor-\nmance ES (n = 19 “responder”, 0.12 ± 0.09; 95%CI = –0.07, 0.30 vs. n = 53 “non-\nresponder”, 0.06 ± 0.04; 95%CI = –0.02, 0.15).\nBody Composition Comparison of ES By Supplementation Regimen,\nSubject Training Status, and Gender\nThe influences of the duration of creatine supplementation, training status of sub-\njects, and gender of subjects on body composition (n = 163) are presented in Table 4.\nA greater (p = .0003) ES for body composition change occurred following short-\nterm loading regimens (0.26 ± 0.03) compared to regimens including both loading\nand low-dose maintenance supplementation, the ES of which (0.04 ± 0.05) was not\nsignificantly greater than zero. There was no difference between untrained (0.14 ±\n\nCreatine Supplementation: A Meta-analysis / 209\n0.09) and trained (0.18 ± 0.03) subjects in mean body composition ES, although the\nmean ES following supplementation in trained subjects was significantly greater\nthan zero (95%CI = 0.12, 0.24). The mean body composition ES was greater than\nzero for males (0.22 ± 0.04, 95%CI = 0.15, 0.29) but not for females (0.04 ± 0.10,\n95%CI = –0.18, 0.26) or groups including male and female subjects (0.09 ± 0.05,\n95%CI = –0.03, 0.21). The effects of creatine supplementation on ES for specific\nbody composition variables are presented in Table 5. The primary body composi-\ntion variables reported in the literature are body mass (BM), lean body mass (LBM),\nand estimated %fat. Significant ES existed for LBM (0.33 ± 0.06, 95%CI = 0.20,\n0.46, p < .0001) and BM (0.16 ± 0.04, 95%CI = 0.08, 0.25, p < .0001), with average\nincreases of 2.2 ± 0.7% and 1.2 ± 0.3%, respectively. Across the literature, estimated\n%fat and fat mass were unaffected by creatine supplementation.\nPerformance Comparisons of ES By Supplementation Regimen,\nExercise Type, Subject Training Status, and Gender\nInfluences of supplementation duration, type of exercise, and subject demographics\non ES for performance variables are presented in Table 6.

    "discussion": "Although numerous reviews support the efficacy of creatine supplementation in\nimproving performance and increasing body mass (5, 22, 48, 52, 66, 97, 115), a\nprevious meta-analysis, including a limited number of studies, reported no ergo-\ngenic effect of creatine on anaerobic performance (63). This meta-analysis includes\na larger number of studies and also addresses the efficacy of creatine supplementa-\ntion in the areas of body composition and aerobic performance. The mean effect size\nfor all performance and body composition variables in this meta-analysis was sig-\nnificantly greater than zero (mean ± SE = 0.22 ± 0.02). This effect size is small\naccording to Cohen’s classification (18) and is surrounded by considerable variance\n(range = –1.4 to 3.52; SD = 0.50), highlighting the fact that the efficacy of creatine is\nnot consistent for all variables and populations studied. It should also be pointed out\nthat the meta-analysis has acknowledged limitations, as described by LeLorier et al.\n(58). For example, there may be a disproportionate number of studies in the litera-\nture that meet inclusionary criteria and also report statistically significant findings.\nNevertheless, the mean improvement following creatine supplementation (5.7 ±\n0.5%) was significantly greater than that observed following placebo supplementa-\ntion (2.4 ± 0.4%). In addition to being statistically significant, this difference in\nimprovement (3.3 ± 0.47%) is also of physiologic significance in many perfor-\nmance tasks. Therefore, this meta-analysis lends additional support to the effective-\nness of creatine in increasing total and lean body mass, and performance in high-\nintensity, short-duration, repetitive tasks such as the number of weight-lifting\nrepetitions and resistance.\nTable 8 Effect of Creatine Supplementation on ES for Selected Measures\nof Anaerobic Performance Tasks > 30 to ≤ 150 s in Duration\nES % change from baseline\nVariable nM ± SE 95%CI Placebo Creatine\nAll ES* 135 0.19 ± 0.05 0.10, 0.28 –2.0 ± 0.6 4.9 ± 1.5\nRepetitions* 2 0.63 ± 0.02 0.40, 0.86 9.9 ± 9.9 32.3 ± 3.1\nWork (Nm)* 18 0.31 ± 0.04 0.22, 0.40 0 ± 0 20.5 ± 7.2\nVO 2 (L/min)* 6 0.30 ± 0.06 0.24, 0.36 1.1 ± 0.6 8.0 ± 0.4\nPower (W)* 11 0.23 ± 0.09 0.03, 0.43 –1.0 ± 3.8 5.6 ± 2.9\nRate (m/s)* 8 0.12 ± 0.09 0.05, 0.20 0.3 ± 0.3 1.4 ± 0.2\nWork (J)* 41 0.09 ± 0.04 0.01, 0.16 –6.8 ± 1.4 –4.1 ± 2.3\nTime (s) 42 0.23 ± 0.13 –0.04, 0.50 –0.4 ± 0.5 6.3 ± 2.1\nDistance (cm) 5 0.05 ± 0.11 –0.25, 0.34 0.8 ± 1.5 –0.2 ± 2.1\nNote.

Of the 96\npublished papers in this meta-analysis, 61 (64%) measured 617 performance vari-\n\n216 / Branch\nables of ≤ 30 s in duration, with 45 reporting an ergogenic effect (1–3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13,\n15, 16, 21, 24, 36, 38–40, 47, 49–51, 54, 55, 59, 64, 67, 69, 72–76, 81, 82, 85, 91, 96,\n102, 103, 105–108, 111, 112, 114). Although 17 studies (7, 9, 19–21, 23, 27, 32, 45,\n46, 56, 60, 70, 71, 77, 78, 90) reported no ergogenic effect, the significant overall\neffect size of 0.24 ± 0.02 supports the efficacy of creatine supplementation in tasks\nof ≤ 30 s in duration. As illustrated in Figure 2 and Table 7, creatine supplementation\nimproves leg ergometer performance (revolutions/min, power [W] and work [Nm,\nJ]), isotonic lifting mass (repetitions, 1-RM), isometric force production (N), and\nisokinetic torque production (Nm).\nIt has been suggested that creatine supplementation may improve prolonged\nanaerobic performance due to buffering action and less reliance on glycolysis re-\nsulting in decreased lactate formation (115). Twenty-five studies measured the\neffect of creatine on performance of 135 predominantly anaerobic variables of 30 to\n150 s in duration, with 17 of these studies reporting improved performance follow-\ning creatine supplementation (11, 12, 26, 28, 38, 44, 57, 59, 61, 75, 87, 88, 92, 95, 99,\n102, 109) and 8 reporting no ergogenic effect (14, 29, 65, 71, 82, 98, 101, 104).\nAlthough smaller than the effect size for shorter-duration tasks, the overall effect\nsize (0.19 ± 0.05) following creatine supplementation is significant and supports the\nhypothesis that creatine may also improve performance in tasks such as isotonic\nlifting mass (repetitions), isometric work (Nm), and leg ergometer power and work\n(W, J) that rely primarily on anaerobic glycolysis.\nAlthough the effect of creatine supplementation on aerobic performance has\nreceived much less research attention, it has been suggested that creatine may\nmodify substrate utilization during aerobic activity and possibly improve endurance\nperformance (94). Eighteen studies measured the effect of creatine supplementation\non 69 aerobic variables that were longer than 150 s in duration. Improved aerobic\nperformance following creatine supplementation was reported in some (33, 61, 64,\n68, 79, 80, 87, 93, 109) but not other studies (4, 7, 28, 89, 94, 95, 101, 105, 114). The\noverall effect size for these variables was significantly greater than zero (0.20 ±\n0.06, 95%CI = 0.06, 0.34). Exclusion of large ES (n = 12) from one study (68)\nresulted in a mean ES of 0.09 ± 0.07 (95%CI = –0.04, 0.22). Bicycle ergometry was\nthe only mode of aerobic exercise for which a significant ES was observed. As\ndemonstrated in Figures 2–4, the ergogenic potential of creatine supplementation\ndiminishes with increasing duration of activity.\nIt has been suggested that “responders” to creatine supplementation have a\nlow baseline muscle total creatine and/or a greater increase in muscle total creatine\nfollowing supplementation (16, 37, 41). Total muscle total creatine was measured\nby biopsy before and after supplementation in seven performance studies (6, 16, 29,\n33, 60, 90, 112). Although the percentage of significant performance findings was\ngreater for a higher compared to a lower uptake of creatine, the actual effect sizes\nbetween “responders” and “non-responders” were similar and negligible.\nEffect of Creatine on BM and LBM\nChanges in BM (ES = 0.17 ± 0.05) and LBM (ES = 0.36 ± 0.06) have been reported\nfollowing creatine supplementation. Of 67 studies which measured body mass/\ncomposition, 43 reported increases in BM or LBM (3, 4, 6, 8, 13, 15, 20, 21, 23, 24,\n32, 34, 35, 37, 39, 44, 45, 49–51, 53, 54, 59, 61, 62, 65, 67, 69, 71–73, 77, 85, 90, 91,\n94, 99, 105, 109–113), and 24 reported no change in BM or LBM following creatine\n\nCreatine Supplementation: A Meta-analysis / 217\nsupplementation (7, 9, 25–27, 31, 38, 40, 55–57, 60, 64, 75, 76, 79, 82, 87, 89, 92, 93,\n96, 98, 102). Supplemented creatine may increase intramuscular water content due\nto osmotic action (42, 111). This mechanism would explain the often-reported\nincrease in BM following short-term creatine supplementation. Another proposed\nmechanism is increased training volume following creatine supplementation, which\nmay represent an indirect long-term mechanism leading to increases in BM and\nLBM. It has also been suggested that creatine may influence protein anabolism and/\nor catabolism. Creatine may function at the transcriptional or translational level to\nstimulate contractile protein biosynthesis (43, 116). It has been further suggested\nthat increased cellular hydration may serve as a signal for increased protein synthe-\nsis and/or decreased protein degradation (54, 116). Regardless of the involved\nmechanism(s), ES following acute loading was greater than long-term maintenance\nsupplementation (0.26 ± 0.04 vs. 0.04 ± 0.05; Table 4), suggesting a greater absolute\ngain in mass early in a supplementation regimen and a more modest, gradual gain\nwith maintenance supplementation. It is important to point out, however, that main-\ntenance supplementation was often combined with resistance training, during which\nincreased BM and LBM also occurred in the placebo group. More research is needed\nto examine all of these potential mechanisms.\nEffect of Supplementation Duration, Exercise Type, Training Status,\nand Gender on Performance ES\nCreatine supplementation regimens which included maintenance dosages resulted\nin greater improvement from baseline in performance (12.3 ± 1.8%) compared to\nshort-term loading regimens (5.3 ± 0.5%), but there was no difference in ES (0.26 ±\n0.04 vs. 0.22 ± 0.02; Table 6). Since maintenance supplementation is usually ac-\ncompanied by training, which also elicits improvement in the placebo group, this\nfinding suggests the presence of an augmented ergogenic effect of creatine when\ncombined with training. The explanatory mechanism (i.e., indirect effect of in-\ncreased training volume or direct stimulation of protein synthesis) awaits further\nstudy.\nIt has been suggested that creatine supplementation may improve ATP resyn-\nthesis between repetitive bouts of exercise (37). The ES for repetitive-bout exercise\n(second and higher bouts, 0.25 ± 0.03) was greater than the ES for single-bout (and\nthe first of multiple-bout) exercise (0.18 ± 0.02; Table 6). This finding would seem\nto support this ergogenic mechanism, although others have failed to find evidence of\nenhanced ATP resynthesis following repetitive exercise (29, 108). Several studies\nhave reported the effects of creatine supplementation on the decline in performance\nover multiple bouts of high-intensity, short-duration (≤30 s) exercise (13, 19, 21, 23,\n47, 60, 64, 67, 70, 85, 90, 105). The mean ES for percent decrement in performance\nin these studies was not significantly different from zero (–0.04 ± 0.06; 95%CI =\n–0.16, 0.09; Table 7), suggesting a resistance to fatigue associated with creatine\nsupplementation. These findings support the possibility of improved performance\nin multiple bouts of high-intensity, short-duration exercise.\nThe majority of performance variables (77%, n = 635) were measured in a\nlaboratory setting. Jumping, sprint running, skating, and swimming were consid-\nered as field-based performance tasks in this meta-analysis. These performance\nmodes have received much less research attention than laboratory-based tasks such\nas bicycle ergometry, isokinetic, isometric, and isotonic performance. The fact that\n\n218 / Branch\na greater ES was observed in the laboratory setting is no doubt related to greater\ninternal validity and control of extraneous factors, such as ambient conditions, that\ncould potentially affect performance. However, the ultimate application of the ergo-\ngenic effect of creatine or any supplement will be on the playing field in actual\ncompetition (i.e., a field-based setting). Although more research is needed on the\neffect of creatine supplementation in field settings, the observed ES of 0.14 ± 0.04\nindicates that creatine supplementation has minimal effectiveness in improving\nswimming, running, and jumping performance. It has been speculated that the\nincreased body mass following creatine supplementation may be ergolytic for these\nactivities (64).\nThere was no difference between trained and untrained subjects in ES for\nbody composition or performance variables, but untrained subjects exhibited a\ngreater percent change in performance from baseline, which may be explained by\nthe presence of a training or learning effect. It should be pointed out, however, that\nthe classification of training status was less than perfect. For example, “healthy,\nphysically active” subjects were considered as trained in this meta-analysis. Since\ncreatine supplementation has been reported to benefit deconditioned patients with\ncongestive heart failure (2, 33), gyrate atrophy (86), mitochondrial cytopathies (95),\nand McArdle’s disease (114), the effects of trained state on the ergogenic effect of\ncreatine merit additional investigation.\nCreatine supplementation has been studied most extensively in trained male\nsubjects. The effects of creatine supplementation on female subjects has been the\nfocus of only nine studies of 41 performance variables, with an ergogenic effect\nreported in three studies (55, 96, 107). It has been reported that females may have\nhigher endogenous muscle creatine (30) and that those with high endogenous muscle\ncreatine do not respond as favorably to supplemental creatine (37). It is unclear if the\npaucity of support for an ergogenic effect of creatine in females is due to a physi-\nologic mechanism or simply the unavailability of data. This meta-analysis found the\nrelative improvement from baseline following creatine supplementation to be greater\nin females (14.8 ± 3.8%) than males (5.5 ± 0.7%) and subject groups consisting of\nmales and females (7.9 ± 1.1%). Furthermore, there was no difference between\nmales and females in ES for performance variables. More direct comparisons of the\neffects of creatine supplementation in males and females are needed to elucidate any\ngender differences in response to creatine supplementation.\nThe effect of creatine supplementation is more pronounced in upper-body\nperformance tasks (ES = 0.42 ± 0.07) than in lower-body (0.22 ± 0.02). Total body\nexercise is unaffected by creatine supplementation (0.13 ± 0.04). The reason for this\nobservation is unclear. It is possible that preferential uptake of supplemented creat-\nine by upper-body musculature could be related to a report of greater creatine uptake\nby fast-twitch fibers (16), but there has been no comparison of creatine uptake\nbetween upper-body and lower-body musculature. This issue merits further investi-\ngation.\nResearchers often receive funding or support from dietary supplement manu-\nfacturers. Such relationships might present a potential conflict of interest. On the\none hand, the supporting entity would presumably want objective research findings\nthat are based on statistical probability. On the other hand, the supporting entity\nwould also have a vested interest in the outcome of the study. The percentage of\nstudies that reported at least one significant finding and also acknowledged\n\nCreatine Supplementation: A Meta-analysis / 219\nmanufacturer involvement was similar to the percentage of non-sponsored studies\nwith a significant finding. Furthermore, there was no difference in mean ES between\nstudies receiving support and those receiving no support. It is important to point out,\nhowever, that no attempt was made to ascertain the degree of manufacturer support,\nwhich could range from simple donation of supplements to full financial sponsor-\nship. Moreover, manufacturers are unlikely to publish a non-ergogenic study. Within\nthe limits of these data, sponsorship of creatine research by supplement manufactur-\ners does not appear to be a source of bias.\nThere are several limitations to this meta-analysis. First, the quality of each\nstudy, which is considered in some meta-analyses, was not considered in the present\nstudy. This is acknowledged as a potential weakness. Second, some studies em-\nployed methods for which there was insufficient or unknown reliability. The dis-\ntinction that was made between “laboratory-based” and “field-based” tasks is de-\nbatable. It may be argued that this distinction is irrelevant so long as the methodology\nis valid, reliable, and objective. On the other hand, there is merit to examining skills\nthat are actually employed in competition. Third, this meta-analysis did not address\nthe potential health effects of long-term creatine supplementation, which is a source\nof concern among clinicians. Creatine supplementation has also been reported to\nexcessively elevate lower leg muscle compartment pressure following endurance\nexercise (84). This side effect could result in impaired performance and medical\nintervention. It was also assumed that all supplemented creatine was free of impuri-\nties. Although a recent retrospective study reported no adverse effects of creatine\nsupplementation (9.7 g · d\n–1 for up to 4 years) on blood chemistry, muscle injury, or\nother side effects (83), the long-term effects of creatine remain largely unknown.\nTherefore, it would behoove all potential and current users of creatine to continue to\nseek current information about the effects of creatine from authoritative sources.\nIn conclusion, ES was greater for lean body mass following short-term CS,\nrepetitive-bout exercise tasks ≤ 30 s, and upper-body exercise. Creatine supplemen-\ntation has improved repetitions accomplished, mass lifted (kg), force (N) and power\n(W) generated, and work accomplished during high-intensity, short-duration (≤30\ns) isotonic, isometric, isokinetic, and leg ergometer exercise. ES for performance\ntasks diminishes with increasing duration of exercise, an observation that is consis-\ntent with energy system specificity for various exercise tasks along the intensity/\nduration continuum. Creatine supplementation does not appear to improve swim-\nming and running performance. The literature does not support an effect of gender\nor training status on ES following creatine supplementation.\nReferences\n1. Aaserud, R., P. Gramvik, S.R. Olsen, and J. Jensen.
