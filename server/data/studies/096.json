Studies have \nshown that resistance training (RT) can maintain lean mass, but few have observed increases in \nlean mass. This may be due to the lower intensities of RT used or the inadequate protein intake \nof the participants in these studies. PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of higher intensity RT \n(n=16) and RT+protein (n=17) interventions to improve muscular strength and body composition \nin BCS over 12 weeks. METHODS: Thirty-three (59 ± 8 years) BCS were measured pre and \npost RT for the following variables: muscular strength (chest press and leg extension) via one-\nrepetition maximal (1-RM) and handgrip (HG) strength via HG dynamometer, physical function \nvia the Continuous Scale of Physical Functional Performance, body composition (lean mass, fat \nmass) via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), blood biomarkers of muscle and fat \nmetabolism [insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and adiponectin] and total body inflammation \n[human C-reactive protein (CRP)]. RT consisted of two days/wk using ten exercises performed \nfor three sets of 10-12 repetitions at ~65-85% of 1-RM. RT+protein also consumed 20g of a \nprotein supplement twice a day. Data were reported as means and standard deviations. \nDependent variables at baseline were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). \nWhen group differences in baseline variables were observed, an analysis of covariance \n(ANCOVA) was performed with the baseline variable as the covariate. Dependent variables \nwere analyzed by a 2 by 2 factorial ANOVA (group x time) with repeated measures on the last \nfactor. One-way ANOVA post hoc tests were used to compare group or time differences. An \nintent-to-treat analysis was used to evaluate pre and posttest scores to address the effects of the \ninterventions on all randomized participants regardless of whether they completed the study or \n\nxi \n \nnot by using the principle of last observation carried forward. Significance was accepted at \np<0.05. RESULTS: The total weight training volume (weight lifted x repetitions x sets) over the \n12 weeks for the upper body exercises was 227,673 ± 65,732 kg for the RT+protein group and \n185,760 ± 62,932 kg for the RT group and was approaching significance (p= 0.071). The total \ntraining volume for lower body exercises was not different between the RT+protein and RT \ngroups (258,877 ± 75,997 vs. 219,274 ± 73,906 kg). Average RT intensity was not different \nbetween the RT+protein and RT groups during weeks 1-6 for upper body (70 ± 7% vs. 71 ± 4%) \nand lower body (69 ± 5% vs. 70 ± 6%) percent of baseline 1-RM and during weeks 7-12 for \nupper body (77 ± 7% vs. 75 ± 8%) and lower body (80 ± 9% vs. 83 ± 9%) percent of the 6-week \n1-RM. No group x time interactions were detected for variables measured except upper body \nlean mass, which was higher in the RT+protein group compared to the RT group at 12 weeks. \nBoth groups (n=33) significantly increased upper (86 ± 22 to 115 ± 29 kg), lower body (97 ± 25 \nto 116 ± 31 kg), HG (51 ± 9 to 54 ± 8 kg) strength and total physical function (69 ± 14 to 72 ± 15 \nunits). Lean mass (40.4 ± 6.2 to 41.3 ± 6.5 kg), fat mass (29.4 ± 9.3 to 28.9 ± 9.4 kg), percent \nbody fat (41.4 ± 5.4 to 40.4 ± 5.6%) significantly improved over the 12 weeks of RT. There were \nno group by time interactions for any of the blood biomarkers. Serum levels of IGF-1 \nsignificantly increased from baseline to 12 weeks in both the RT+protein group (110 ± 40 to 119 \n± 37 ng/ml) and the RT group (102 ± 34 to 115 ± 33 ng/ml) but adiponectin and CRP did not \nchange. At baseline, the RT group had a significantly greater percent difference in upper \nextremity volume, a measurement of lymphedema, than the RT+protein group (9.5 ± 11.2 vs 1.8 \n± 10.2%, respectively. The percent difference in upper extremity volume significantly decreased \nfrom baseline to week 5 to a greater extent in the RT group (9.5 ± 11.2 to 0.18 ±7.7%) than the \nRT+protein group (1.8 ± 10.2 to 1.87 ± 7.4%). The average percent difference in upper extremity \n\nxii \n \nvolume of all the BCS significantly decreased from 5.6 ± 11.2% at baseline to 2.0 ± 5.6% in \nweek 9.",
    "conclusions": "Twelve weeks of RT at 65-81% of 1-RM was well tolerated and \nsignificantly improved muscular strength, physical function, body composition and lymphedema \nin BCS. RT significantly increased IGF-1, the blood biomarker of muscle metabolism in both \ngroups, but the values did not exceed the normal range. Although the protein supplement was \nwell tolerated and adhered to, supplementing with 40g/day did not provide additional benefits to \nRT. The greater increments in upper body lean mass were likely due to the somewhat higher \ntraining volume in the upper body exercises in the RT+protein group and not the daily protein \nsupplementation. RT at higher intensities can help counteract the cancer related changes and \nsignificantly improve muscular strength and body composition without exacerbating \nlymphedema or causing any musculoskeletal injuries. \n\n1 \n \nCHAPTER 1 \nINTRODUCTION \nBreast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in American women with approximately \n225,000 new cases and 40,000 annual deaths reported in 2012 (245). Despite the improved five-\nyear survival rate in the past several years, breast cancer survivors (BCS) are left to struggle with \nadverse side effects as a result of chemotherapy and hormone suppressant therapy (213). Cancer \ntherapy negatively affects body composition, particularly the loss of muscle mass, which may \nlead to sarcopenia (98), and the concurrent increase in fat mass, termed sarcopenic obesity. This \nmultifactorial ill condition will ultimately have negative impacts on the quality of life and \nphysical function of BCS (27, 263). Importantly, the accelerated decrements in muscle mass can \nlead to frailty, a geriatric syndrome in which the risks of adverse health and physical outcomes \nincreases as a result of the declining physiologic capacity of aging adults (87, 99). Recently, \nVillasenor et al. (2012) sought to find the association between the prevalence of sarcopenia, \ndefined as the appendicular skeletal mass (ASM;kg) adjusted for height (m²) of <5.45 kg/m², and \nbreast cancer specific mortality in 471 women with breast cancer (stages I-III). Sarcopenia as \ndefined by an ASM index of <5.45 kg/m² was evident in 75 (16%) of the women, and was an \nindependent predictor of mortality (273). In a few studies by Prado et al. breast, lung and \ngastrointestinal cancer patients with sarcopenia were 2.6 times more likely to develop secondary \nmalignancies (211), as well as being at an increased risk of chemotherapy toxicity (208) and a \nhaving a shorter time to death (209). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of breast cancer \ntherapy related decrements in skeletal muscle mass is paramount to implementing appropriate \ninterventions. Two intervention programs that may be promising for BCS include resistance \ntraining (RT) and protein supplementation. \n\n2 \n \nIntervention programs in RT at intensities between 60 and 100% of 1-repetition \nmaximum (1-RM) have been shown to increase skeletal muscle mass and strength in healthy \nadults (43, 101). Although RT interventions in BCS have shown improvements in muscular \nstrength (59, 284), few have reported significant accretion of muscle mass (235) while other \nstudies have found no increases in muscle mass (160, 284) following RT. These differences may \nbe due to the differences in exercise intensity that these studies used with the former prescribing \n3 sets of 70-75% of 1-RM and the latter prescribing 1-3 sets of 60-80% of 1-RM. As a result it is \nreasonable to deduce that exercise intensity is a determining factor for providing a stimulus \nsufficient enough to observe changes in muscle mass in BCS. Be that as it may, a more \nsignificant stimulus for accretion of muscle mass in BCS may be the provision of amino acids. \nHealthy older adults have a blunted post-absorptive muscle protein synthetic rate in \nresponse to amino acid feeding (112, 139). Therefore, it has recently been recommended that \nolder adults need to increase their daily protein intake from the RDA of 0.8 g/kg/day to \nconsuming 1.4-1.6 g/kg/day (25, 51). This increased protein dose may be most appropriately \nachieved by the addition of a protein supplement to the diet of the aging adult. Further, \nincreasing the daily protein intake of older adults by consuming a 15g protein supplement twice \na day in combination with RT, has been shown to be sufficient enough to increase lean body \nmass (+ 1.3 ± 0.4 kg; P=.006) in frail elderly adults (78 ±1 years) (267). Thus, a combined RT \nand protein supplementation intervention may provide the necessary stimulus to overcome the \nage- and disease related anabolic resistance to accretion of muscle mass in BCS. To date, no \nstudies have investigated this non-pharmacological intervention to counteract the disease and \ntreatment induced side effects in BCS. \n \n\n3 \n \n1.1 Purpose \n The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the efficacy of RT and protein \nsupplementation in combination or RT alone for improving body composition (lean mass and fat \nmass), muscular strength, physical function, and biomarkers of muscle and fat metabolism in \npost-menopausal breast cancer survivors (BCS). \n \n1.2 Research questions \nThe present study was designed to answer the following research questions: \n1. To what extent will 12 weeks of RT combined with protein supplementation (RT+protein) \nimprove body composition (lean body mass and fat body mass) compared to RT alone in 33 \npost-menopausal BCS? \n2. To what extent will 12 weeks of RT combined with protein supplementation \n(RT+protein) improve skeletal muscular strength and physical function compared to RT \nalone in 33 post-menopausal BCS? \n3. To what extent will 12 weeks of RT combined with protein supplementation (RT+protein) \nimprove metabolic biomarkers of muscle (insulin-like growth factor 1), fat metabolism \n(adiponectin) and inflammation (C-reactive protein) compared to RT alone in 33 post-\nmenopausal BCS. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \n1.3 Research hypotheses \nThe hypotheses of the present study included the following: \n1. Post-menopausal BCS participating in RT combined with protein supplementation will \ndemonstrate greater increases in lean body mass and greater decrements in fat mass compared \nto BCS participating in RT alone. \n2. Post-menopausal BCS participating in RT combined with protein supplementation will \ndemonstrate greater improvements in skeletal muscular strength and physical function \ncompared to BCS participating in RT alone. \n3. Post-menopausal BCS participating in RT combined with protein supplementation will \ndemonstrate greater improvements in the metabolic biomarkers of muscle and fat metabolism, \ninsulin-like growth factor 1 and adiponectin, respectively and decreases in the biomarker of \ninflammation, C-reactive protein, to a greater extent compared to BCS participating in RT \nalone. \n \n1.4 Assumptions \nAssumptions for the present study included the following: \n1. All participants accurately reported their age, breast cancer medical history (diagnosis and \ntreatment), menopausal status, current exercise status, and current dietary intake. \n2. All participants followed the instructions given to them regarding the maintenance of their \ncurrent dietary habits and current daily physical activity outside of the prescribed intervention. \n3. All participants followed the instructions given to them regarding protein supplement \nconsumption and honestly and accurately reported their adherence to the protein \nsupplementation when prompted to do so. \n\n5 \n \n4. All laboratory equipment yielded accurate measurements over the course of repeated testing. \n \n1.5 Delimitations \nThe delimitations of the present study included the following: \n1. Only stage 0-III female BCS were allowed to participate in the present study. Therefore, male \nbreast cancer patients, female survivors of stage IV breast cancer, or females with active \ncancer, were not eligible to participate in the present study. \n2. Individuals with uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes, or heart disease were not eligible to \nparticipate in the study. \n3. Female BCS must have been 3 months post-surgery and 2 months post-cancer therapy. \n4. The present study consisted of 33 BCS, with 16 in the RT group and 17 in the RT+protein \ngroup for an intervention period of 12 weeks. \n5. The women in the RT+protein group consumed 20 g of protein in a ready to drink bottle twice \na day. The women consumed the first 20 g serving of protein within 30 minutes of completing \neach RT session on training days and in the morning before breakfast on the non-training \ndays. The women consumed the second 20 g serving of protein as their last meal consumed \nwithin 30 minutes of going to bed on all days of the week. \n \n1.6 Limitations \nThe limitations of the present study included the following: \n1. Only female BCS were included in the present study, and therefore results obtained may not \nbe generalized to male breast cancer patients or patients suffering from other forms of cancer. \n\n6 \n \n2. Participants were recruited on a volunteer basis, and thus may have been more motivated than \nthe general female breast cancer population. Therefore, the results obtained may not be \ngeneralized to the entire breast cancer population. \n3. Participants were recruited from the Tallahassee, Florida and surrounding regions. Therefore, \nthe results obtained may not be generalized to female breast cancer survivors in other \ngeographical regions. \n \n1.7 Definition of terms \n Adjuvant Chemotherapy – Chemotherapy prior to or after surgery and/or radiation treatment \nthat is prescribed to eradicate undetectable residual cancer cells after surgery has eradicated \nall detectable tumor (medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com). \n Appendicular Skeletal Muscle Index - appendicular skeletal muscle mass (arm + leg muscle \nmass) adjusted by height (ASMI; kg/m²) (183). \n Aromatase - An enzyme responsible for the synthesis of estrogens from androgen precursors. \nAs a result of estrogens role in promoting certain cancers, inhibition of aromatase enzymes is \na form of cancer treatment (medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com). \n Aromatase inhibitors - Drugs that prevent the formation of the hormone estradiol by \ninhibiting the enzyme aromatase.

Voluntary weight loss occurs with increased exercise and food restriction. However, \nunintentional weight loss in older adults is often a result of chronic disease, starvation and/or the \nnatural aging process and puts them at risk for poor health outcomes. The most common cancer \nin older women is breast cancer and it is often associated with disease and treatment related \naccelerations in skeletal muscle loss. The incidence of cancer diagnosis is highest in older adults \n(>60 years) (128) and increases with advancing age (26). Although survival rates from breast \ncancer are high, survivors are often left to live with alterations in body composition as a result of \nthe cancer itself and cancer therapy. Breast cancer survivors (BCS) experience accelerated \nmuscle loss from hormone therapy, chemotherapy and corticosteroids that interfere with the \nmechanisms of muscle protein synthesis (MPS) (68, 98, 104, 213). \n Older men and women who have a body mass index (BMI) of less than 22 kg/m² (>65 years) \nand less than 20.5 kg/m² (>75 years) have been found to have impaired functional capacities and \nincreased mortality risk (5, 20, 152). Several factors contribute to the weight loss in older adults, \nbut an important contributor is the loss of muscle mass across the life span. Healthy young adults \nhave a balance between muscle protein synthesis and degradation and therefore have no \nsignificant net change over time. In contrast, as normal aging progresses muscle mass in \nsedentary adults decreases at approximately 1-2% each year after the age of 50 years (123, 124) \nlargely due to reduction in muscle protein synthesis (183). Furthermore, decrements in motor \nunit number (76) and muscle fiber size (29) occur with aging. Muscle wasting due to aging can \n\n10 \n \nlead to decrements in muscular strength (6) and physical performance, which ultimately leads to \nfrailty and disability. \nThe decline in muscle mass across the lifespan can ultimately lead to significant functional \ndeclines and ultimately disability in older adults. Developed in the early 1960’s, Nagi’s model of \ndisablement, identified four related conditions that ultimately lead to disability; active pathology \n(disease or muscular abnormalities), which leads to physical impairments (anatomical and \nphysiological), and thus to the development of functional limitations (physical function and \nquality of life) and eventually disability (132). Sarcopenic or cachectic adults have the potential \nto have impaired ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL) and arrive at disability sooner \nthan their non-sarcopenic and non-cachectic counterparts. \nSkeletal muscle abnormalities, such as sarcopenia and cachexia, are underlying \ncomponents of frailty in older adults (87). Frailty is defined as a geriatric syndrome in which a \ndecline in physiologic reserve increases the risk of adverse health and physical outcomes, \nincluding physical dependence, falls, fractures, and mortality (87, 99). The estimated economic \ncosts associated with sarcopenia was $18.5 billion dollars in the United States in 2000, with a \n10% reduction in the prevalence of sarcopenia projected to save $1.1 billion dollars per year in \nhealthcare costs (127). In addition, healthcare costs attributable to hip fractures are projected to \nincrease by $2 to $6 billion dollars by 2030 (150, 155). Fried et al. (2001) characterized the \nfrailty phenotype as having at least three of the five measurable criteria: (1) unintentional weight \nloss (10 lbs within a year), (2) exhaustion (self-reported), (3) weakness (hand grip strength test), \n(4) slow walking speed, and (5) low physical activity (99). Further measures of frailty include \npoor balance, reduced mobility, inadequate nutritional intake, urinary incontinence and cognitive \nimpairment (87, 99, 222, 224, 262, 286). Older adults (≥ 65 years) comprise over 50% of all \n\n11 \n \nmedical surgeries in the United States of which 16% of the gross domestic product is consumed \nby health care spending (221), frailty in adults contributes to the economic cost of aging. \nThompson et al. (2011) found a significant positive association between pre-operative frailty and \nincreased health care costs six months after colorectal surgery in 60 older (≥ 65 years) men and \nwomen using a pre-operative frailty assessment (221). The cost of operations extends beyond in-\npatient care and therefore it is important to understand and minimize age and disease related \ncontributors of frailty, particularly skeletal muscle disorders. Skeletal muscle disorders and \nmuscle wasting are predominantly realized in the forms of sarcopenia or cachexia, which are \nboth multifactorial conditions that affect the physical function, and overall quality of life of older \nadults (17). These disorders in muscle mass and muscle function can be a result of aging, \nphysical activity and malnutrition (sarcopenia) or due to chronic diseases such as cancer \n(cachexia). \nSarcopenia is defined as the age-related loss of muscle mass, which was first defined in \nthe late 1980s by Irwin Rosenberg (227). Sarcopenia affects 5 to 13% of adults between 60 and \n70 years old, and 11 to 50% of adults over the age of 80 years (181). The World Health \nOrganization (WHO) estimates more than 50 million people worldwide are sarcopenic, with the \nprevalence expected to increase to 1.2 billion people by 2025 (62). Sarcopenia is further defined \nas having an appendicular skeletal muscle mass (arm + leg muscle mass) adjusted by height \n(ASM; kg/m²) of 2 standard deviations or more below the young adult mean of the reference \npopulation (183). Additional criteria for sarcopenia includes an ASM index (ASMI) of <7.26 \nkg/m² in men and < 5.45 kg/m² in women as determined by Baugmeneter et al. (17). However, \nsarcopenia is no longer considered a condition solely associated with aging, but a multifactorial \ngeriatric syndrome (225) that often coincides with other syndromes prevalent in the elderly such \n\n12 \n \nas anorexia, frailty, osteoporosis, and falls (62, 225). Furthermore, a sedentary lifestyle, \ninadequate nutrition, pharmaceutical drugs, and bed rest encompass the multifactorial nature of \nsarcopenia. \nCachexia is severe muscle wasting that is defined as the disease induced, rapid and \ninvoluntary loss of body weight (≥5% of body weight within 12 months). Increased systemic \ninflammation is a key component of cachexia that is often accompanied by reduced food intake \n(anorexia). Additionally an absolute value of muscle mass below the fifth percentile is the \naccepted diagnostic criterion of clinically significant muscle wasting (90). In addition to chronic \ninflammation, increased muscle protein degradation and insulin resistances are prevalent features \nin patients with cachexia (86, 189). Cachexia is commonly observed in patients with advanced \nchronic diseases such as cancer (64, 71), human immunodeficiency virus/acquired \nimmunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) (110), and cardiac cachexia as a complication of \ncongestive heart failure (7). It is estimated that over 1.3 million people in the United States are \naffected by cancer cachexia; this number comprises 30% of all cachexia cases (180). Cancer \ncachexia is most often observed in patients diagnosed with pancreatic, gastrointestinal, colorectal \nand lung cancer (31, 71). In addition to tumor induced inflammation, and anorexia, the lack of \nphysical conditioning seen in these patients may further confound both forms of muscle wasting \n(90). \nInterestingly, cachexia can lead to, but is not always associated with sarcopenia. \nSarcopenic individuals are not necessarily cachectic. Adults with diminished muscle mass but \nwithout rapid, involuntary weight loss including loss of fat mass and measurable systemic \ninflammation are described as sarcopenic. Therefore, the consensus criteria for sarcopenia is \nhaving both diminished muscle mass and diminished muscle function (physical strength and \n\n13 \n \nperformance) as agreed upon by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People \n(EWGSOP), the International Academy of Nutrition and Aging (IANA), and the International \nAssociation of Gerontology and Geriatrics-European Region [IAGG-ER] (225). Therefore, \nindividuals with skeletal muscle loss and function are described as sarcopenic but if their \ncondition includes rapid weight loss (≥5% of body weight within 1β months; or BMI of less than \n20.0 kg/m²) and systemic inflammation associated with underlying illness they are described as \ncachetic (225). Therefore, although both conditions are characterized by similar skeletal muscle \nmass changes, the underlying mechanisms of each differ, and therefore the appropriate \ninterventions may differ. Moreover, physical activity, particularly RT is most appropriate for \nsarcopenia, but may not have a significant impact on cachexia as a sole intervention (225). \nInterventions for cachexia will need to include increasing caloric intake (264), anti-inflammatory \nfoods and supplements in addition to exercise (85, 134, 264). However, both muscular \nabnormalities have some similarities and, therefore, a combination of physical activity and \nnutritional interventions may benefit both. Thus if a common mechanism exists between the two, \nthen a common intervention may exist to target the common pathway involved in the loss of \nmuscle mass. \nAlthough not to the extent as the aforementioned diseases, breast cancer, the most \ncommon cancer occurring in women is often associated with disease and treatment induced \nalterations in body composition, in particular muscle loss and the concurrent increase in fat mass \n(8, 98, 166, 213). Muscle wasting in breast cancer (68, 98) occurs as a result of cancer \nprogression as well as therapy. Cancer drugs, such as anti-androgens, corticosteroids, and \nchemotherapy can cause severe toxicity which results in accelerated loss of muscle mass (98, \n\n14 \n \n213). These treatment related alterations in body composition may lead to sarcopenia and \nsarcopenic obesity in breast cancer patients (211, 212). \nTherefore, appropriate and multifactorial interventions to counteract accelerated muscle \nmass loss in BCS are warranted to prevent further decrements in muscle mass and possible \nprogression to sarcopenia and cachexia. Effective interventions should establish baseline muscle \nmass using imaging techniques such as Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA), measure \nmuscle function (muscular strength tests), and measure current dietary intake. Further an exercise \nand nutrition prescription sufficient to attenuate or reverse muscle wasting is warranted. In \naddition it is plausible that accelerated muscle wasting, will result in decrements in muscular \nstrength thereby impacting physical function and the ability to live independently (27, 53, 227, \n263). Therefore, the years following initial diagnosis may be the most optimal window of \nopportunity for prevention of additional treatment induced muscle wasting. The purpose of the \npresent review is to outline the mechanisms of muscle wasting in healthy aging as well as discuss \nhow this natural process is accelerated in the most common cancer occurring in women, and \nexamine the ongoing research involving treatment and prevention of further muscle wasting that \nmay lead to sarcopenia and cachexia in the breast cancer population. \n \n2.1 Mechanisms of the loss of muscle mass in healthy aging \nThe cause of muscle wasting with healthy aging is multifactorial, with changes in \nneuromuscular function, decreases in physical activity, malnutrition, decreases in satellite cell \nnumber and function, decreases in protein synthesis, decreases in mitochondrial content and \nfunction, changes in hormonal levels, increases in inflammation and oxidative stress, and \nincreases in adiposity. All of these factors together and independently contribute to the loss of \n\n15 \n \nmuscle mass, muscle function and muscle quality (Figure 1) (33, 277). Recent evidence suggests \nthat the aging process results in decreases in muscle mitochondrial content and function, \ndecreases in hormones (androgens, growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1), and \nincreases in inflammation (increased proinflammatory cytokines) that contribute to the decrease \nin muscle mass that eventually leads to sarcopenia (77). In addition, disease progression and \nrecurrence, fatigue and nutritional deficiencies may further exacerbate the skeletal muscle system \nwasting. \n \nFigure 1. Mechanisms of accelerated muscle wasting associated with age, behavior and \ndisease (33). \n \nAdvancing age is thought to be associated with a neurological decline that results in the \nreduction of the number of neuromuscular junctions (44). In a recent study, Chai et al. found a \nsignificant increase in the number of denervated neuromuscular junctions, particularly in the type \nII or fast twitch muscle fibers in older female mice (44). This study may help future studies \n\n\n16 \n \nidentify the specific mechanisms for the loss of motor neurons in aging humans. A recent study \nidentified C-terminal Agrin Fragment, which is the result of the cleavage of a motorneuron-\nderived agrin (a nervous system protein) as a marker of neuromuscular degeneration and a \npotential diagnostic measurement of sarcopenia in older men. The C-terminal Agrin Fragment \nwas found to be associated with decrements in appendicular lean mass in men, but not in women. \nFurther, the concentration of C-terminal Agrin Fragment was reduced by exercise and vitamin D \nsupplementation (78). It is plausible that the loss of neuromuscular junctions in humans is one of \nthe major contributing factors to the decrements in muscle fiber number and size observed in \naging adults. Losses in muscle fiber number and size are most notably seen in the fast twitch \nmuscle fibers (159, 271). \nAlong with the decline in the neuromuscular junction there are also age-related changes \nin satellite cell number and function (271). Satellite cells are muscle stem cells that respond to \nmechanical stress such as exercise to repair and regenerate muscle fibers (256). Satellite cell \ncontent, particularly in fast twitch muscle fibers is reduced in aging adults (271) and function by \nslower migration speeds to damaged fibers in older compared to younger adults (56). The \ncompromised satellite cell function during aging is thought to be due to reduced expression of \nthe glycoprotein integrin that acts as molecules for satellite cell–extracellular matrix adhesion \n(56, 259). The combination of impaired satellite cell content and function and reduction in \nphysical activity as well as inadequate nutrition will inevitably lead to muscle wasting in aging \nadults. \nThe physiological benefits of physical activity in skeletal muscle include improvements \nin mitochondrial content and function (169), satellite cell signaling (256), muscle protein \nsynthesis and reduced long-term inflammation (111). Although the benefits of physical activity \n\n17 \n \nare well documented, the levels of physical activity decrease with age. A study by Morse et al. \n(β004) reported that even healthy physically active older men (≥ 70 years old) were still γ0% less \nphysically active than young adults (19–35 years) (184). \nIn addition to increased physical inactivity, insufficient caloric intake, especially protein \nintake is common in the elderly and can increase muscle wasting (179). Starvation in the elderly, \ntermed anorexia of aging (179, 182) caused by loss of appetite, changes to the gastrointestinal \nhormones, and social and economic limitations (15) deprive the skeletal muscles of amino acids \nrequired for protein synthesis, thereby creating protein imbalance in favor of protein degradation \n(179, 278). Recently Houston et al. (2008) found a positive association between protein intake \nand lean mass in community dwelling older (70-79 years) men and women and found those who \nconsumed greater (1.1 g/kg/day) than the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of 0.8 g/kg/day \nhad smaller decrements in lean mass over three years than those that consumed protein at or \nbelow the RDA (122). The type, timing and quantity of protein recommended to prevent muscle \nwasting will be discussed later; however inadequate protein intake in aging adults combined with \nphysical inactivity may further exacerbate the decline in muscle protein synthesis associated with \naging. \nMuscle protein synthesis (MPS), particularly of the myosin heavy chain via the Akt-\nmTOR-p70S6K pathway (Figure 2) declines with age (183). Impaired MPS is likely caused by \nchanges in the anabolic hormones, specifically the blunted anabolic response of insulin in the \nmuscles of older adults in the postprandial period (112). Skeletal MPS in response to nutrient, \ncontractile, and hormonal stimuli occurs via integration of signals by the kinase mammalian \ntarget of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR is found in two complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) \nand mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). The role of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is the integration \n\n18 \n \nof signals from growth factors, energy, oxygen and amino acids to regulate downstream \npathways that stimulate mRNA translation of proteins (157). In response to the binding of insulin \nto its receptor on the cell surface, tyrosine kinase activates the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) \nand phosphor-inositide 3-kinase (PI3K) that leads to the activation of Akt. mTORC1 is inhibited \nat rest by tuberous sclerosis (TSC2), however, Akt inactivates TSC2 thereby activating mTORC1 \nwhich phosphorylates p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E \nbinding protein1 (4E-BP1) that increases mRNA translation for the synthesis of proteins (157). \nSynergistically, mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) promotes MPS by activating Akt. However, in \nresponse to low levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP; starvation), AMP-activated protein \nkinase (AMPK) activates TSC2 thereby inhibiting mTORC1 mediated protein synthesis (288). In \naddition mTORC1 signaling is inhibited by rapamycin. Although MPS occurs in older adults in \nresponse to anabolic stimuli, this mechanism is attenuated with aging (79). Additionally, \nmitochondrial dysfunction (244), insulin resistance (112), and chronic inflammation (133) \ncontribute to the age-related impairments in MPS. The decline in mitochondrial content, \nfunction and regulatory enzymes with aging has been well documented (126, 191, 244) and \nidentified as another major contributor to the decline in skeletal mass with healthy aging. \nEvidence of declining mitochondrial function has been demonstrated in studies reporting a \ndecline in both maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) (223, 244) and resting oxygen \nconsumption (VO2) (214). Additionally, the maximal synthesis rate of ATP as measured by the \nrecovery rate of phosphocreatine by magnetic resonance spectroscopy after a brief exercise bout \nhas been shown to be lower in older adults (243). \n\n19 \n \n \nFigure 2. Mechanisms of muscle protein synthesis (147) \n \nTherefore, the decline in the oxidative capacity of the mitochondria will result in the \ndecline in skeletal MPS, an ATP dependent process, thereby leading to the loss of skeletal \nmuscle with age. Further, the reduction in physical activity, particularly aerobic exercise which is \na potent stimulus for the increase in the ability for muscles to produce ATP (54, 243) may add to \nthe decrements in skeletal muscle oxidative capacity. This is a plausible mechanism for muscle \nloss with age as Lanza et al. (2008) showed that older adults (59-76 years old) who aerobically \nexercised regularly (≥60 minutes, 6 days per week) for over four years were able to maintain \ntheir mitochondrial content (156). Aging has also been shown to have lower expression of three \nkey skeletal muscle proteins; (1) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Ȗ coactivator 1α \n\n\n20 \n \n(PGC-1α – stimulates synthesis of new mitochondria), (2) AMP-activated protein kinase \n(AMPK- increases mitochondrial synthesis and enzyme content but paradoxically inhibits \nskeletal muscle protein synthesis and hypertrophy), and (3) silent mating type information \nregulation 2 homolog sirtuin 1 (SIRT1- attenuates metabolic disorders associated with age) (107, \n135, 156, 158). \nIn addition to the aforementioned mechanisms, hormonal alterations in androgens \n(testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, estrogen), insulin, growth hormone (GH) and \ninsulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) contribute to loss of muscle mass with aging (167, 231). \nTestosterone increases skeletal MPS (268), however levels decrease by 1% per year from the age \nof 30 years in men (93) and even more rapidly in women between the ages of 20 to 45 years \n(178). Testosterone supplementation has been shown to increase muscle mass (257) and strength \n(250) in older men. However, testosterone treatment is associated with health risks including \nsleep apnea and increases prostate cancer risk (188). Dehydroepiandrosterone is a precursor to \ntestosterone and estrogen, and increased levels of this hormone by supplementation in older men \nand women do not directly increase muscle size or strength (65). Although estrogen has beta \nreceptors on skeletal muscle membranes (30), the direct effect of estrogen on muscle mass is less \nunderstood with some studies showing a correlation with muscle mass (125) and others reporting \nno association in women ≥65 years of age (17). \nOf more importance may be the role of insulin, GH and IGF-1 in aging muscle. Insulin \ninhibits muscle protein breakdown in response to carbohydrate and amino acid feeding (217) and \ntherefore promotes the balance of protein turnover towards protein synthesis. Insulin resistance, \ncommon in older adults may reduce the potential of insulin to up-regulate protein synthesis \n(200). GH acting via IGF-1 is influential in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass. In skeletal \n\n21 \n \nmuscle IGF-1 is produced in two isoforms both of which decline with age; (1) mechano-growth \nfactor (MGF) released in response to exercise is important for satellite cell replenishment and (2) \nIGF-1 which up-regulates MPS. Ultimately, IGF-1 via the Akt-mTOR-p70S6K pathway is a \nparamount mediator of muscle hypertrophy and repair (201). Hameed et al. (2004) found IGF-1 \nexpression increased in 19 healthy, older men (70-82 years) with GH treatment and an increase \nin MGF expression with the addition of 12 weeks of RT to the intervention (117). Interestingly, \nVitamin D, important for regulating bone and calcium homeostasis (66), has been shown to \nimprove severe muscle weakness (175), and increase fast twitch muscle fiber number and size \n(232). Vitamin D levels are often deficient in the elderly (109, 280) and the expression of \nvitamin D receptors on skeletal muscle declines with age (232). \nAge-related muscle loss has also been linked to chronic inflammation and oxidative stress \nassociated with both aging and diseases associated with advancing age (e.g. atherosclerosis, \nmetabolic syndrome) (50, 187, 252). Recently, Meng et al. (2010) reported that molecular \ninflammation and oxidative stress causes protein imbalance, myonuclear apoptosis, and \nmitochondrial dysfunction (170). Similarly, Chung et al. (2011) suggested that the driving force \nof skeletal muscle degeneration is the continuous, irregular inflammatory process during aging \n(49). Advancing age is often associated with increased adiposity, which in turn increases the \ninflammatory environment that inevitably accelerates muscle loss, a condition termed sarcopenic \nobesity (94, 238, 266). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms in which both oxidative stress \nand chronic inflammation as a result of aging and obesity is imperative. \nReactive oxygen species (ROS) increase with aging thereby elevating pro-inflammatory \nmediators including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and \ninterferongamma (IFN-Ȗ) mediated by the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) that is \n\n22 \n \nstimulated by both ROS and inflammation (49, 170). The continuous activation of NF-κB by \nROS and the inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-6) causes a chronic inflammatory state that \nincreases protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome (UbP) proteolytic pathways (Figure \n2) (52, 251, 285). Furthermore, muscle regeneration, repair and hypertrophy are impaired due to \nthe disruption of the muscle stem cells known as satellite cells (48, 154). In addition, NF-Κb \ninterferes with the processing of the myogenic regulatory factors necessary for satellite cell \nproliferation (MyoD and myf-5) and differentiation (myogenin and MRF4) (153). \nLastly, muscle atrophy occurring as a result of increased myonuclear apoptosis (death of \na myonucleus) and decreased regenerative capacity may be due to age-related chronic \ninflammation. Evidence suggests the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α triggers apoptosis via \nmitochondrial dysfunction (164) and death domain receptor-mediated apoptosis when TNF-α \nbinds to the TNF-α receptor that is also known as the death receptor (74, 133, 205). Although not \nto the same extent, the aforementioned pathways in which chronic inflammation during the \nnormal aging process leads to muscle wasting is similar to that of muscle wasting associated with \nchronic diseases (cachexia). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that acute and chronic \ndiseases (cancer, COPD, AIDS) accelerate age-related muscle loss and ultimately lead to \ncachexia is paramount to identifying appropriate counter-measure interventions. \n \n2.2 Skeletal muscle loss in breast cancer \nThere appears to be a related pathway to muscle wasting from treatments for breast \ncancer with that of normal aging but it occurs at an accelerated rate (37, 233). While surgery is \noften the primary treatment for breast cancer (mastectomy), neoadjuvant (before) and adjuvant \n(after) therapies such as hormone suppression therapy and chemotherapy are often included to \n\n23 \n \nslow tumor growth or alleviate symptoms (230, 241, 242). Although these treatments are often \neffective, with increasing 5-year survival rates (129, 130), BCS are left to live with the side \neffects of treatment (98, 213, 240). \nInterventions to attenuate and possibly reverse this advanced muscle wasting are unlikely \nto succeed (89), unless identification of BCS survivors who are at risk and the prescription of \nappropriate exercise and nutritional strategies for this population are implemented. Routine \ntreatments for the hormone-dependent cancer in women (breast) include neo or adjuvant \nchemotherapy, estrogen ablation, and radiation are discussed below. These methods of treatment \ndirectly and indirectly disrupt muscle anabolic pathways. In an attempt to attenuate tumor \nproliferation, cancer drugs such as corticosteroids, anti-androgens, and chemotherapy agents \ntarget the PI3K, Akt, and mTOR molecular pathways that are responsible for stimulating MPS \n(21). \n \n2.3 Adverse effects of breast cancer treatment on muscle \nCommon chemotherapy agents such as methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, and \ndoxorubicin are primarily metabolized in the lean body mass; therefore it is plausible that this \ncompartment of the body is susceptible to wasting due to drug toxicity (177, 210). Hence, as \nskeletal muscle mass is a major component of the lean body compartment, BCS are at risk of \naccelerated muscle mass loss. However, often the accretion of fat mass during and after \nchemotherapy conceals the decline in muscle mass in cancer patients (209). Therefore, it is \nimportant not to restrict the discussion of muscle wasting in BCS to those who appear thin. \nFreedman et al. (2004) observed significant increases in body fat percentage during (+2.3 ± 4%; \nP=0.02) and 6 months after (+4.0 ± 6%; P = 0.01) treatment with concurrent decrements in fat-\n\n24 \n \nfree mass (-2.2 ± 4%; P = 0.02 and -3.8 ± 6%; P = 0.01 respectively) in 20 women (stages I-III) \nundergoing adjuvant chemotherapy (98). It has been reported that chemotherapy agents such as \n5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (213), and fluoropyrimidines (5-fluorouracil \n(5FU) and capecitabine) (208, 211), cause severe toxicity in patients with low lean mass relative \nto their height (213). The goal of these cytotoxic, antineoplastic agents is to inhibit tumor cell \ndivision and growth; however, these drugs are not specific to cancerous cells and affect cells \nthroughout the body including muscle cells. The molecular pathways (PI3K, Akt and mTOR) for \nmuscle protein synthesis are similar to those for tumor cell growth (21, 81), therefore by \ntargeting these pathways antineoplastic agents suppress Akt and mTOR, thereby inducing muscle \natrophy (9, 213). Additionally, hormone suppressant therapies such as aromatase inhibitors to \nsuppress estrogen production and selective estrogen receptors modulators such as tamoxifen are \nother common adjuvant treatments for breast cancer patients that can negatively affect body \ncomposition in BCS (230). However, the role of estrogen on skeletal muscle mass is less \nunderstood, with some studies showing an association (125) and others not (17), between muscle \nmass and estrogen. The most significant impact of hormone therapy on body composition is the \ninhibition of the protective effects of estrogen on bone resorption; thereby increasing bone \nmineral loss in BCS (215). Thus, the loss of skeletal muscle during breast cancer is primarily \ncaused by the aforementioned mechanisms of tumor induced increases in systemic inflammation \n(75), however side effects of adjuvant chemotherapy also negatively influence behavioral factors \nimportant for maintenance of muscle mass. \nAs previously mentioned, a significant contributor to skeletal muscle wasting in aging \nadults is physical inactivity. However, in the case of breast cancer, women receiving adjuvant \nchemotherapy agents often have decreased levels of physical activity largely as a result of \n\n25 \n \nincreased levels of fatigue. In one study the chemotherapy agent doxorubicin was reported to \nincrease fatigue in 25 breast cancer patients (aged 40-65 years; stage I-II) during the first \ntreatment regimen and one-third of the women continued to experience fatigue after treatment \n(36). Similarly, in a larger study, Bower et al. (2000) reported one-third of 1,957 BCS \nexperienced more severe and persistent fatigue than their healthy age-matched counterparts (24). \nTherefore, the elevated levels of fatigue during and after chemotherapy may play a significant \npart in decreased levels of physical activity in BCS (68). Demark-Wahnefried et al. (1997) \nobserved a significant decrease in mean physical activity energy expenditure from 514 ± 117 \nkcal/d to 461 ± 83 kcal/d (P = 0.04) in 18 women receiving chemotherapy (69). Later, the same \ngroup found 36 women had significantly lower energy expenditure from physical activity (P = \n0.01) over 1 year of chemotherapy than 17 women receiving localized treatment (68). In \naddition, the women receiving chemotherapy in this study experienced a significant loss in total \nbody lean mass (-0.4 ± 0.3 kg; P = 0.02) and leg lean mass (-0.2 ± 0.1 kg; P = 0.01) whereas \nthose receiving localized treatment did not (68). However, not all studies report significant \ndecrements in lean mass after chemotherapy (38). Although Del Rio et al. (2002) reported an \nincrease in lean mass in 30 breast cancer patients (stage I-II) after 6 months of chemotherapy; \nthis was also accompanied by an increase in total body weight (67). Therefore, this may have \nbeen an adaptive increase in lean mass in response to the extra weight gained. \n \n2.4 Adverse effects of breast cancer treatment on muscular strength and physical function \nAs physical activity is a potent stimulator of MPS even in older adults, the decrease in \nphysical activity caused by treatment-induced fatigue may accelerate skeletal muscle mass loss \nin BCS. Further, if these decrements in skeletal muscle mass are not attenuated, it is plausible \n\n26 \n \nthat BCS may develop sarcopenia or cachexia and arrive at disability sooner. Progression to \nphysical disability is likely largely due to the fact that skeletal muscle mass is associated with \nmuscular strength and physical function (196, 260). In fact, Winters-Stone et al. (2009) found an \nassociation between lower leg strength and incidence of falls in BCS (281). Impaired muscular \nstrength in BCS may also be related to the side of the body the cancer was treated. Merchant et \nal. (2008) observed significantly weaker shoulder protractors, retractors and extensors in the side \nof the body affected by cancer in 40 BCS who had completed all treatments at least 6 months \nprior (171). Reduced muscular strength in older adults without prior cancer diagnosis is \nassociated with the inability to perform ADL and increased risk of falls (1, 216). As a result of \nthe aforementioned paths to muscle wasting in BCS, it is probable to conclude that BCS are at \nrisk of arriving at physical dependence prematurely. \nIn a long term study, Sweeney et al. (β006) found that 4β% of 1,068 BCS (≥5 years) \nreported the inability to perform heavy household work, 26% were unable to walk half a mile, \nand 9% could not walk up and down a flight of stairs (263). Furthermore, women who were \nsurvivors for less than 2 years had higher prevalence rates of functional impairments than those \nwho were survivors for more than 2 years (263). This demonstrates that improvements in \nfunctional ability over time since diagnosis and treatment are possible in BCS and appropriate \ninterventions to counteract functional impairments may be necessary early during survivorship. \nAs functional limitations experienced by many BCS after adjuvant chemotherapy will inevitably \nlead to reduced quality of life (27) and increased risk of mortality (209), identifying other \ncontributing factors of skeletal muscle loss in BCS is imperative. In addition, more research \nidentifying non-pharmacological interventions to preserve and accrue muscle mass in BCS is \nwarranted. \n\n27 \n \n2.5 Resistance training in healthy aging adults \nExercise training, particularly RT is an effective strategy to counteract skeletal muscle \nloss. Although numerous benefits from aerobic exercise in aging adults exist (105), this review \nwill focus on RT and only include combined exercise programs when paucity of data exist. It is \nwell documented that RT between 60 to 100% of the 1-repetition maximum (1-RM) stimulates \nmany adaptions in skeletal muscle that promote increases in muscle mass and strength in older \nadults (42, 95, 101, 287). Resistance training provides the mechanical stimulus needed to \nattenuate and even reverse age-related muscle loss by increasing MPS (239) via the mTOR/Akt \npathway (Figure 2), increasing anabolic hormones (253), and promoting the activation and \nproliferation of satellite cells (272). Most importantly, RT decreases the activity of cytokines \n(TNF-α; IL-6) (58), which play an important role in both age and disease related skeletal muscle \ndegradation. Fourteen weeks of supervised heavy RT (3 sets; 10-12 repetitions; 80% of 1-RM; 3 \ndays per week) significantly increased both type I and II muscle fiber cross sectional area \n(muscle biopsy of vastus lateralis) in 28 healthy older (>65 years of age) men and women \n(P<0.05) (28). More recently, Candow et al. (2006) showed that 12 weeks of RT (3 sets; 10 \nrepetitions; 70% of 1-RM; 3 days per week) significantly increased lean mass (Bod Pod), muscle \nthickness of the elbow, knee and ankle flexors extensors (B-Mode Ultrasound) as well as upper \nand lower body strength (1-RM) in 29 older men (59-76 years; P<0.05) (42). Of most \nimportance to aging adults, the same group later reported that the age-related deficits in total \nbody lean mass (Bod Pod), regional muscle thickness (B-Mode Ultrasound) and muscular \nstrength (1-RM) were reversed after 22 weeks of heavy supervised RT (3 sets; 10 repetitions; \n70% of 1RM; 3 days per week) in 17 healthy older men (60-71 years) (43). After 22 weeks of \nRT, the lean mass, muscle thickness and strength were comparable to that of healthy sedentary \n\n28 \n \nyounger men (18-31 years) (43). Resistance training promotes the maintenance and accretion of \nmuscle mass in healthy older adults thereby attenuating the age-related decrements in muscle \nmass and progression to sarcopenia. It is possible these benefits extend to BCS as well. \n \n2.6 Resistance training in breast cancer survivors \nSimilarly, RT in BCS decreases fatigue (237), increases muscular strength (148), and \nimproves quality of life (194). However, conflicting findings have been reported in regards to \nincrements in lean mass in BCS following a RT program with only one study observing a \nsignificant training effect lean mass (235), some showing gains in lean mass only when \ncompared to the non-exercising control groups (16, 59, 284), and others not reporting significant \ngains (248). The only study to report a significant training effect on lean mass was a six-month \nRT program (3 sets; 10-12RM; 2 days per week) that significantly increased lean mass from \nbaseline by 0.88 kg (P < 0.01) in 39 breast cancer survivors, as measured using DXA (235). \nHowever, in another study breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy exercised for 21 \nweeks in a combined RT (2-3 sets; 40-60% of 1-RM; 2 days per week) and aerobic training \nprogram (n=10; mean age ± SD 57.5 ± 23.0 years). The women significantly increased their \npercent lean body mass (+4.0% versus -0.2%; P=0.004), assessed by 3-site skin-fold \nmeasurements, and increased muscular strength (1-RM) only when compared to the non-\nexercising controls (n=10; mean age ± SD, 56.6 ± 16.0 years) (16). A RT program for 17 weeks \nat 60-70% of 1-RM (2 sets; 8-12 repetitions; 3 days per week) elicited significantly higher \nincrements in lean body mass (+1.0 kg; 95% CI: 0.5 to 1.5kg; P=0.015) compared to a usual care \ngroup (+0.2kg; 95% CI: -0.3 to 0.6kg) in breast cancer patients beginning chemotherapy (59). In \ncontrast, 16 weeks of RT (2-4 sets; 10 repetitions; 80% of 1-RM; 2 days per week) and aerobic \n\n29 \n \ntraining program in sedentary, overweight BCS had no effect on body composition (160). \nRecently, Winters-Stone et al. (2011) reported that a one year resistance and impact (jump) \nexercise program (1-3 sets; 8-12 repetitions; 60-80% of 1-RM; 3 days per week) in \npostmenopausal BCS (≥ 50 years of age) did not elicit a significantly greater increments in lean \nmass compared to women in the control group participating in stretching exercises (284). A 6-\nmonth resistance training study (60-70% of 1RM; 2 days per week) by Simonavice et al. (248) \ndid not report any significant increases in lean body mass from baseline in 27 BCS, however, the \nwomen did maintain their lean mass over the 6 months of training as measured by DXA. \nData are conflicting whether resistance training improves lean mass in BCS. Some of the \nstudies show increases of 2.7 - 4.0% in lean mass only when compared to the non-exercising \ncontrols, or maintenance of lean mass and only one has reported a significant 1.15% body fat (P \n= 0.03) decrease in body fat (235). Some of the differences in results could be due to the \nintensity of the training programs not being great enough to increase lean mass or the duration \nand frequency of exercise not being long enough. Importantly, many of the studies do not report \nthe nutritional status of their participants which may be a major limitation. In a cross-sectional \nstudy by Page et al. (197) found that the BCS who were consuming higher levels of protein \n(>20%) in their diet had higher total BMD than BCS who consumed less. However, there was \nnot a significant correlation between dietary protein and lean mass (r =0.219). Only calcium was \nsignificantly correlated with lean mass in this study (r=0.444; P < 0.05). Therefore, dietary \nintake may play a role in modulating body composition in BCS. Further studies including data on \nthe nutritional status of BCS may elucidate the differences in lean mass observed in interventions \nfor BCS. \n \n\n30 \n \n2.7 Dietary influences on muscle mass in breast cancer \nPoor dietary habits have been implicated with the risk of developing hormone dependent \ncancers (46, 144). Dietary factors influence age at menarche, height, weight and hormones, all of \nwhich play a role in the incidence of breast cancer (55, 143). To date alcohol intake (116), high \nfat intake (255) and low fiber and vegetable consumption (143), soy and tea have been \nimplicated with the risk of breast cancer (116, 120, 143, 206, 254). More importantly dietary \nhabits influence body composition, with obesity increasing the risk of developing breast cancer \nin postmenopausal women by 50%, primarily because of elevated aromatase regulated estrogen \nproduction in fat cells (143). \nHowever, less is known about the influence of dietary protein intake in women diagnosed \nwith breast cancer. Inadequate caloric intake deprives skeletal muscle of amino acids for MPS \nand is commonly observed in patients with cancer cachexia (90). However, energy imbalance by \nexcess caloric intake can cause obesity related metabolic changes such as insulin resistance \nthereby down-regulating the IRS-1-PI3K pathway for Akt-mTOR mediated MPS (Figure 2) (19, \n57). Denmark-Wahnefried at al. (2001) reported breast cancer patients maintained caloric intake \nduring adjuvant chemotherapy (68), whereas, Harvie at al. (2005) observed an increase in caloric \nintake (118). Hence, it is plausible that energy imbalance created by excess calories in the \npresence of reduced physical activity over the disease course contributes to muscle loss \nexperienced by BCS. Therefore, a calorie restricted, high protein diet in combination with \nexercise may be appropriate for reducing fat mass while preserving or accruing muscle mass in \nBCS as observed in aging adults without cancer (258). \n \n\n31 \n \n2.8 The role of protein supplementation to augment the anabolic effects of resistance \ntraining \nIn addition to RT as an appropriate intervention for cancer survivors, protein \nsupplementation may provide additional benefits. As cancer patients who have had hormone \ntherapy often experience side effects such as accelerated muscle loss and fat accretion, \nsupplementing with protein in combination with RT may preserve lean body mass and promote \nfat loss. Several studies have reported preservation of muscle mass and weight loss with an \nincrease in protein intake in healthy obese adults (138, 141, 142, 174). The same body \ncomposition benefits may extend to BCS. To the best of our knowledge there have been no \nstudies to investigate the possible benefits of protein supplementation in combination with RT as \nan appropriate (non-pharmacological) intervention for BCS to counteract the side effects \nassociated with cancer therapy. However, animal studies have shown that manipulating the \ndietary carbohydrate:protein ratio in favor of increased protein intake (40% energy from \ncarbohydrate; 35% energy from protein) reduces breast tumor progression in rats (186) and \ntumor development and progression in mice (15% energy from carbohydrate; 58% energy from \nprotein) (119). \n \n2.9 The anabolic effect of protein on skeletal muscle \nProtein is a major nutritional determinant of muscle mass via stimulation of the PI3K, \nAkt, mTOR molecular pathways for MPS (Figure 2). Amino acids from dietary protein, \nparticularly the essential amino acid (EAA) leucine, up-regulate the guanosine triphosphate-\n(GTP)-binding protein, Ras homologue enriched in brain (Rheb), which binds directly to mTOR \nand increases the activity of mTOR kinase which phosphorylates p70S6K to initiate protein \n\n32 \n \nsynthesis (162). Amino acids and IGF-1 also positively regulate Rheb by binding to IRS-1, \nwhich activates the PI3K-Akt to phosphorylate and down-regulate the activity of TSC 1 and TSC \n2, which lowers the capacity for Rheb to stimulate mTOR kinase. In response to low ATP (low \nenergy), AMPK inhibits Rheb by promoting the formation TSC1 and TSC2 thereby inhibiting \nMPS (140, 207). Increased protein intake, as part of a weight loss diet or in combination with \nexercise has been shown to have positive effects on body composition (39, 123, 198, 249). \n \n2.10 Protein needs of aging adults \nIncreasing dietary protein has the potential for muscle mass accretion and optimizing \nbody composition in healthy aging adults. The current recommended daily allowance (RDA) for \nprotein is 0.8 g/kg/day for adults over the age of 19 years (40). However, early nitrogen balance \nstudies have suggested aging adults (56-80 years) need to consume 1.14 g/kg/day of protein (40). \nIn fact, it has recently been reported that 25% of older adults consume less than the RDA of \nprotein (0.8 g/kg/day) and up to 50% consume less than the recommended 1.14 g/kg/day of \nprotein (228). A more recent recommendation for protein intake for older adults has increased \nthe daily needs of older adults to 1.4-1.6 g/kg/day (25, 51). Currently, the gold standard for \nassessing protein consumption with protein needs is the adaption-accommodation principle, in \n‘adaption’ refers to a steady state environment in which physiologic functions are either \naugmented or not compromised in response to a change in protein intake. Whereas, \n‘accommodation’ is defined as a non-steady state in which physiologic functions are hindered in \norder to conserve protein in response to a decline in protein intake (41). Physiologic \naccommodation was observed in a 14-week study with 29 older men and women (54-78 years) \nconsuming the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for protein (0.8 g/kg/day), as a 21% \n\n33 \n \nreduction in nitrogen excretion was reported and was significantly correlated (r=0.83) with a -1.7 \ncm2 decrease in thigh muscle cross-sectional area (P < 0.05) (41). A decrease in nitrogen \nexcretion with a concurrent decrease in fat-free mass may indicate the compromise of MPS in \norder to conserve total body protein in response to decreased protein intake. The findings from \nthis study indicated that the RDA for protein may not be adequate for the maintenance of skeletal \nmuscle in aging adults. \nRecent evidence has suggested older adults have an anabolic resistance to amino acid \nfeeding thereby having a blunted post-absorptive muscle protein synthetic rate which leads to \nmuscle loss (112, 139). Several pathways have been implicated, including impaired digestion \nand absorption of protein (22), as well as reduced amino acid uptake (72), insulin-regulated \ntissue perfusion (218) and signaling protein activity in the muscle (34, 102) (Figure 3). However, \ndespite this, the anabolic resistance to MPS with aging is reversed if physical activity is \nperformed prior to ingestion of protein in elderly men (198). The improvements in the utilization \nof dietary amino acids for de novo MPS after physical activity may continue for several days \n(35) thereby highlighting the importance of regular physical activity in older adults (34). Aged \nskeletal muscle has been estimated to have 50% lower concentrations of mTOR and p70S6K \nthan younger muscle (63). Additionally, insulin resistance common in older adults decreases the \nuptake of amino acids into skeletal muscle and down-regulates the anabolic effect of protein \n(103). Furthermore, the delivery of amino acids to skeletal muscle following mixed meals may \nbe impaired, as elevated levels of the potent vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 (ET-1) have been \nobserved in the elderly (103). Therefore, the decreased blood flow caused by elevated ET-1 \ndiminishes amino-acid mediated stimulation of MPS and contributes to muscle wasting as \nillustrated above in Figure 2 (276). \n\n34 \n \nThe aforementioned mechanisms of the inability of aging adults to maximally utilize \nprotein for MPS indicate the need for increased dietary protein in this population. Further, \nincreased protein intake to 1.4 – 1.6 g/kg/day may be most optimal in healthy older adults or \ndiseased adults with or at risk of severe muscle wasting. However, achieving an increased \namount of protein may be difficult and inconvenient while trying to limit the amount of fat in a \ntypical American diet. Ideally, achieving the increased protein and caloric needs of these patients \nvia normal whole foods would be optimal; it may not be the most practical. Individuals with or at \nrisk of sarcopenia, cachexia or the elderly in general typically already consume less calories than \nneeded in their normal diets (185, 220), therefore asking them to increase their caloric intake is \nnot plausible, particularly if they are currently undergoing some form of treatment. Thereby, the \nuse of oral nutritional supplementation, most importantly protein supplementation appears to be \nthe most feasible method of increasing protein intake in these populations. \n \n \nFigure 3. Mechanisms of anabolic resistance of muscle protein synthesis with aging (34). \n\n\n35 \n \nA high quality protein supplement such as whey protein could help adults increase their \nprotein intake, in a convenient liquid supplement form that may improve compliance and \nadherence to dietary interventions. Protein quality is essential to stimulating MPS. Proteins that \nprovide the greatest proportion of the essential amino acids (EAAs), including the branched \nchain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine and valine are the most effective at stimulating \nMPS (114). EAAs, most importantly BCAAs, initiate the signaling molecules for protein \nsynthesis in addition to being substrates themselves. The BCAA leucine plays the most important \nrole in MPS. Whey protein, a by-product of the cheese making process, constitutes 20% of the \ntotal protein in milk, and is the liquid that remains after the removal of the curds (caseins) (151). \nWhey is a milk-based protein that has an anabolic effect in promoting MPS. Whey protein \nsupplementation has an important role not only in recovery after exercise, but also in promoting \nMPS at various times of the day (114). Composed of approximately 26% BCAAs, whey protein \nis a high quality protein with high leucine content. Leucine at a dose of 3.5g is likely the most \nimportant essential amino acid for initiating MPS via the mTOR/Akt pathway (Figure 2). Whey \nprotein is also a potential appetite inhibitor, as it has the potential to prolong satiety by \npromoting the secretion of active Glucagon-like Peptide 1 (GLP-1), an appetite inhibiting \nhormone, by inhibiting dipeptidyl peptidase IV, the hormone that is responsible for breaking \ndown active GLP-1 (113). Several studies have shown the benefits of milk-based proteins such \nas whey in healthy adults (14, 138, 265, 270). \n \n2.11 Protein supplementation in healthy older adults \nEvidence is growing to recommend increasing the protein:carbohydrate ratio in attempt \nto improve muscle mass in older adults (149, 267). Consumption of protein before or after \n\n36 \n \nexercise augments the anabolic effect of exercise and results in accretion of muscle mass (198, \n204), and has been recommended to combat sarcopenia and frailty in the elderly (226). An early \nstudy found that older men participating in a 12-week RT program (3 days per week) and given a \nnutrition supplement (43.3% carbohydrate,16.6% protein, 40.1% fat) had greater gains in mid-\nthigh cross sectional area than the men on an ad lib diet but not consuming the protein dense \nsupplement. The differences between groups in this study is most likely because the \nsupplemented group consumed significantly more calories than the non-supplementing group, \n(2960 ± 230 vs 1620 ± 80 kcal/d) by the end of the 12 weeks, although both groups were on an \nad lib diet (172). The inclusion of the added calories may be of benefit to both sedentary and \nactive, older adults as it is reported that the energy intake of older adults is often inadequate \n(220). Later, Singh et al. (1999) reported a 10.1 ± 9.0% (P = 0.033) increase in type II muscle \nfiber area after 10 weeks of RT (3 days/week) with a nutritional supplement (360 kcal; 60% \ncarbohydrate, 17% soy-based protein, 23% fat,) in 26 older men and women (N=26; 72-98 years) \n(249). These earlier studies observed benefits of nutrient supplements with a more traditional \nmacronutrient distribution; however evidence showing the manipulation of this distribution in \nfavor of increased protein in older adults is promising. Campbell et al. (1995) compared protein \nconsumption of either the RDA of 0.8 g/kg/day or 1.6 g/kg/day older adults (56-80 years) \nparticipating in a 12-week RT program and found the participants who consumed 1.6 g/kg/day of \nprotein had a greater uptake of amino acids for protein synthesis (P<0.02) but no differences in \nlean mass were observed (39). A recent study reported a significant increase in lean body mass \n(+ 1.3 ± 0.4kg; P=.006) after consuming a 15g protein supplement twice a day (1 after breakfast \nand 1 after lunch) in frail elderly adults (78 ±1 years) who were also participating in a 24-week \nRT program (2 days per week) compared to a group of frail elderly adults only participating in \n\n37 \n \nthe RT intervention. However, although strength and physical performance significantly \nincreased in both the groups (P=.000) as a result of the RT, only the group consuming the daily \nprotein supplement experienced significant improvements in lean body mass. These findings \nsupport the hypothesis that dietary protein supplementation augments the gains in muscle mass \nin elderly people performing RT (267). Of clinical relevance, the net 1.3kg increase in lean mass \nin the protein supplementation group was enough to offset the reported age-related 0.5 – 1.0kg \nper year loss in muscle mass (123). In contrast Chalé et al. (2013) did not observe any significant \ngroup differences in gains in lean mass between mobility limited older adults (70-85 years) \nconsuming a 40g whey protein concentrate supplement (20g twice a day) or an isocaloric (45 g \nmaltodextrin) placebo who were participating in a 6-month RT program (3 days per week). \nHowever, in response to the RT intervention, both the whey protein and placebo groups \nincreased lean mass (1.3% and 0.6% respectively), muscle cross-sectional area (4.6% and 2.9% \nrespectively), all measures of muscular strength (16-50%) and stair-climbing performance. The \nlack of gains in muscle mass induced by the protein supplement in this study was attributed to \nthe distribution of the supplement into two separate 20g servings, which may not have had a \nsufficient leucine content needed to maximally stimulate MPS in older adults (45). As previously \nmentioned, older adults have a blunted anabolic response to amino acid feedings, and it has been \nreported that older adults require a greater amount of leucine to optimally stimulate MPS than \nyounger adults (140). The inability of 20g of a protein supplement to augment the anabolic effect \nof RT was also observed by Moore et al. (2009) in young adults (176). However, Cuthberson et \nal. (2005) did not observe increased gains in MPS after protein supplement doses greater than \n20g in older adults (63). The inconsistency of these findings highlight the need for more research \ninvolving protein supplementation in older adults and the optimal dose to maximally stimulate \n\n38 \n \nMPS. Nevertheless, the potential benefits of protein supplementation to increase or maintain \nmuscle mass are evident, and are possibly applicable to diseased populations. \n \n2.12 Protein supplementation in breast cancer survivors \nAlthough the aforementioned studies discuss the potential benefits of higher protein \nintake to promote favorable body compositional changes in healthy, older adults, few studies \nhave examined the effect of a high quality protein such as whey and its influence on cancer \npatients and survivors who have experienced disease and treatment related muscle wasting. To \ndate, no studies have included an oral protein supplement to increase lean mass in BCS. \nHowever, a few studies have investigated the use of an oral protein dense supplement to increase \nmuscle mass in patients with cancer cachexia. \nAs previously mentioned, cancer cachexia patients have reduced rates of MPS and \nincreased rates of protein degradation as a result of chronic inflammation and anorexia that leads \nto severe muscle wasting (90, 261). Vissers et al. (2005), observed lower plasma amino acid \nconcentrations in breast, colon and pancreatic cancer patients compared to age and sex matched \ncontrols; thereby leading to the availability of amino acids for MPS (275). Amino acid feeding \nwas reported to acutely stimulate MPS in advanced ovarian cancer patients with cachexia after \nconsumption of 40g of amino acid supplement; however, the anabolic response was blunted \ncompared to the healthy older controls (73). The use of an oral protein supplement has the \npotential to counteract muscle wasting in cancer patients (137). An early study found \nconsumption of an energy dense n-3 fatty acid enriched oral protein supplement (310 kcal; 16 g \nprotein; 1.1 g eicosapentaenoic acid) twice a day for eight weeks was significantly correlated \nwith increase in lean body mass (r = 0.33, p = 0.036) in 95 cachectic pancreatic cancer patients \n\n39 \n \nand was significantly different from 105 patients consuming the isocaloric, isonitrogenous \ncontrol supplement. Both supplements were effective in attenuating weight loss, but the addition \nof the n-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid appears to augmented gains in lean mass (91). \nEicosapentaenoic acid has been shown to have anticachetic effects by inhibiting proteolysis \ninducing factor’s (PIF) regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway thereby \ndown-regulating protein degradation (279). Therefore, the addition of n-3 fatty acids to protein \nsupplements may be beneficial in promoting MPS in cancer patients. A promising study by \nDeutz et al. (2011) investigated the effect of a high protein, leucine rich (4.16g free leucine) \nformulated medical beverage (EXP n=12; 27% kcal from whey protein) on muscle protein \nsynthesis compared to a control medical beverage (CON n=12; 15% kcal from casein protein) in \na heterogeneous group of cancer patients with cachexia (70). They found that a leucine rich \nmedical protein beverage significantly stimulated muscle protein fractional synthesis rate (FSR) \nin cancer patients compared to a conventional medical food (P = 0.023) (70). Therefore, a \nleucine rich nutritional supplement has the potential to improve muscle protein synthesis in \ncancer patients. More human studies investigating the appropriate dose and type of protein \nrequired to maximally stimulate MPS in cancer patients is needed. However studies involving \ncachectic mice have shown an increase in MPS (82-84) and an attenuation of muscle mass loss \n(199) after consumption of high doses of leucine. Further, although limited data exist, it is \nplausible that BCS who experience treatment induced muscle wasting can benefit from oral \nprotein supplementation to preserve and/or gain muscle mass. More research investigating the \nuse of oral protein supplementation in BCS is warranted. Additionally, the influence of RT and \nprotein supplementation to alter biomarkers of muscle and fat metabolism such as IGF-1, \n\n40 \n \nadiponectin and C-reactive protein in favor of accretion of muscle in BCS needs further \ninvestigation. \n \n2.13 Resistance training and insulin-like growth factor \nAlthough serum levels of the anabolic hormone IGF-1 decrease with age and therefore \ncontribute to the age-related loss of skeletal muscle, elevated levels of growth factors such as \ninsulin and IGF-1 increase the risk of developing breast cancer in postmenopausal women (146). \nOften associated with obesity, the increased levels of insulin and IGF-1 lead to the increased \nsecretion of estrogen by adipose tissues that can cause the down-stream development of \nestrogen-mediated breast carcinogenesis (146). Hence, a paradox exists in regards to increasing \nlevels of anabolic hormones such as IGF-1 through various means such as resistance exercise \nand potentially increasing the risk of cancer reoccurrence in BCS. Normal serum IGF-1 levels in \nhealthy adults range from 40-258 ng/mL, with the average for women over the age of 45 years \nold ranging from 106-143 ng/ml (100). In healthy overweight and obese adults (53.3 ± 8.7 yrs, \nmean age ± SD; 32.2 ± 3.4 kg/m², BMI) progressive RT (6-12RM, 6 sets per muscle group, 3 \ndays/week) and higher protein intake (43.5 ± 1.6% of total energy intake) significantly increased \nIGF-1 values (+16.0 ± 7.5%; P < 0.05) but did not exceed normal values (11). A 6-month RT \nintervention (2d/wk) did not significantly increase IGF-1 (+8.29 ± 6.26 ng/mL) and significantly \ndecreased levels of IGF-2 (-26.23 ± 16.73 ng/mL; P = 0.02) and body fat (-1.15 ± 0.45%) in 39 \nBCS (53.3 ± 8.7 yrs; mean age ± SD) with normal insulin and IGF axis hormone levels at \nbaseline (235). These results demonstrate that a 6-month RT intervention did not significantly \nincrease IGF-1 levels above normal in BCS. Therefore, RT is a safe exercise modality in BCS, \nand no evidence exists of the contribution of RT to increase IGF-mediated risk of cancer \n\n41 \n \nreoccurrence. More importantly, the ability of RT to reduce body fat in BCS may be more \nclinically relevant as elevated body fat is implicated in altering other hormonal levels such as \nadiponectin. \n \n2.14 Resistance training and adiponectin \nLow levels of adiponectin are associated with obesity and risk of developing breast \ncancer (80, 173). Adiponectin, an adipokine that is secreted by white adipose tissue binds to the \nadipose receptors on the cell membrane and activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), \nwhich inhibits the PI3/Akt pathway for cell growth (146). Interestingly, although adiponectin is \nsecreted by adipose tissue, elevated body fat actually decrease the levels of adiponectin secreted. \nThis is largely due to the obesity related increase in IL-6 and TNF-α which both inhibit \nadiponectin expression (32, 193). This is evident, as adiponectin levels have been shown to \nincrease after weight loss (121, 165). In fact, adiponectin is anti-proliferative, inhibits \nangiogenesis and promotes cell apoptosis. Thus, when adiponectin levels are low, adipose and \ntumor cells develop and proliferate, thereby increasing the risk of obesity and breast cancer \n(192). Conflicting results exist with the direct effect of exercise and diet on adiponectin levels. A \ndiet and/or slow movement, low intensity resistance exercise intervention (2 sets, 20 RM, 3 days \nper week) did not find any significant effect on adiponectin levels (96). Similarly, interventions \nutilizing aerobic exercise with or without diet interventions in postmenopausal women did not \nreport any changes in adiponectin levels (108, 229). It is plausible that the absence of an effect of \nthese interventions on adiponectin may be due to the absence of weight loss (108). Whereas, \naerobic and diet interventions that reported weight loss also observed 6.6 – 9.5% increases in \nadiponectin levels in postmenopausal women (2). Adiponectin levels did increase by 94% in 17 \n\n42 \n \nobese adults after 7 months of an intense exercise (3.3 ± 2.1 hours/day) and diet intervention as \npart of the “Biggest Loser” program (3). However, this intense method of weight loss is most \nlikely not appropriate for BCS and may result in poor adherence to the intervention. A study with \nBCS utilized a 16-week combined RT (lower body exercise; 50 minutes, 2 days per week) and \nhome based aerobic training (90 minutes per week) intervention and did not find any changes in \nadiponectin levels (161). It is conceivable weight loss may be the major determinant in observing \nimprovements in adiponectin levels after exercise and dietary interventions, as there is an inverse \nrelationship between adiponectin levels and adiposity (13). Although limited data exist on the \nimpact of exercise to modulate adiponectin levels in BCS, it is plausible that interventions such \nas RT combined with protein supplementation that have been shown to decrease adiposity in \nhealthy overweight and obese adults (12) may be successful in BCS as well. Furthermore, the \nreduction in inflammation from RT could result in attenuation of the inhibition of adiponectin by \nthe inflammatory markers IL-6, TNF-α and CRP. \n \n2.15 Resistance training and C-reactive protein \nA marker of inflammation that is secreted by the liver in response to elevated IL-6 and \nTNF-α, is CRP which levels have a positive association with risk of breast cancer development \nand reoccurrence (246). As previously mentioned, chronic inflammation is one of the major \ncontributors to the age- related decrements in muscle mass. Many cancers, including breast \ncancer are associated with elevated levels of inflammatory markers such as CRP and IL-6, which \nmay further exacerbate muscle wasting (145). Additionally, CRP levels are positively correlated \nwith body weight (97) and potentially with the risk of developing breast cancer (192). In elderly \nwomen without prior cancer diagnosis, RT (8-RM, days/wk) reduced the circulating marker of \n\n43 \n \ninflammation TNF-α by γ7% and decreased the overall inflammatory environment (IL-6, IL-1ȕ, \nand TNF-α) after 10 weeks of RT (γ sets, 8 RM, γ days per week) (202). In a more recent study \nfrom the same group, RT for 12 weeks (3 sets, 8-12RM, 3 days per week,) decreased circulating \nC-reactive protein by 33%, without any changes in body composition, in obese postmenopausal \nwomen (65.6 ± 2.6 yrs; mean age ± SD) (203). Therefore, RT in healthy postmenopausal women \ndoes reduce inflammation, however less is known whether the same effect of RT occurs in BCS. \nTo the best of our knowledge, only one study measured CRP levels after a RT intervention in \nBCS, and found a non-significant 44% (P=0.29) decrease from baseline after 6 months of RT \n(248). Only two studies have measured CRP levels after an exercise intervention in BCS, but \nthese studies used aerobic training as the exercise modality to modulate CRP levels in BCS. Of \nthese studies, one found aerobic training decreased CRP (88) and the other did not find an effect \nof aerobic training on CRP levels (136). For this reason, more studies are needed that investigate \nthe impact of different modes of exercise on inflammation, which as previously described plays a \nrole in accelerating muscle loss with aging and cancer. \nTherefore, a RT intervention alone or in combination with protein supplementation may \nimprove the hormonal milieu in favor of accretion of muscle mass in BCS by increasing IGF-1, \nwithin normal levels. Furthermore, the potential to decrease body fat may increase adiponectin \nlevels and decrease levels of the inflammatory marker, CRP. Thus, as increased body fat has \nbeen associated with increased risk of cancer recurrence and mortality (269), the potential for a \nRT and protein supplementation intervention for decreasing body fat will be advantageous to \nBCS. \n \n \n\n44 \n \n2.16 Concluding remarks \nBreast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the United States. Despite \nimproved survival rates, the cancer and treatment for cancer accelerates muscle loss in these \npatients to a greater extent than that of normal aging. BCS are left to live with diminished muscle \nmass and function which can ultimately lead to frailty and disability. Further, without \nappropriate interventions muscle wasting in BCS may progress to sarcopenia and cachexia. Non-\npharmacological interventions such as resistance exercise and protein supplementation should be \nimplemented to attenuate or reverse muscle wasting in BCS. The years following initial \ndiagnosis may be the most optimal window of opportunity for prevention of additional \ntreatments and age-related induced muscle wasting. \n \n \n\n45 \n \nCHAPTER 3 \nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS \n3.1 Study overview \n This study was a stratified controlled clinical trial (stratified by age, lean mass, stage of \ncancer, type of cancer treatment, and calcium and vitamin D supplementation) designed to \nexamine the effects of two non-pharmacological treatments on body composition, muscular \nstrength, physical function, and biomarkers of muscle and fat metabolism and inflammation \nduring a 12-week period. Women BCS who received chemotherapy, radiation and/or hormone \nsuppressant therapy alone or in conjunction with any other form of traditional cancer treatment \nand who had completed all their treatments with the exception of hormone suppressant therapy \nwere included. The rationale for accepting BCS still taking hormone suppressant therapies was \nbecause after initial treatments are completed, hormone suppressant therapies are prescribed for \n5 to 10 years. The exclusion of women currently on hormone suppressant therapies would have \nsignificantly reduced the number of participants that would be eligible for the study. \n \n3.2 Inclusion criteria \n Thirty-three post-menopausal (induced or natural) women BCS (stages 0-III), ages 40-75 \nyears, having completed chemotherapy and/or radiation (at least 2 months post treatment), were \nrecruited from Tallahassee, FL and surrounding areas. Women who were taking or who had \ncompleted hormone suppressant therapies were eligible to participate in this study. There were \nno restrictions to race or socioeconomic status. All women had a physician’s consent form \nsigned before participating in the study to verify cancer remission status and the absence of any \nunderlying condition that would contraindicate protein consumption and RT. Thirty-three \n\n46 \n \nparticipants were recruited, with 17 in the RT+protein group and 16 in the RT group. Based on \nthe study by Schmitz et al. who found significant differences between the control and RT group \nthe effect size of 1.14 was calculated from lean body mass (235). Based on an α-level of 0.05 and \n90% power a minimum of 9 participants per group was determined. This study was approved by \nthe Florida State University Institutional Review Board (Appendix A). \n \n3.3 Exclusion criteria \n Male breast cancer survivors were not eligible for this study. Women diagnosed with \nstage IV breast cancer or those who were currently diagnosed with active cancer; those receiving \nendocrine (e.g., prednisone, other glucocorticoids) or neuroactive (e.g., dilantin, phenobarbital) \ndrugs or any other prescription drugs known to influence fat or muscle metabolism; those with a \nhistory of hypo or hyperthyroidism or any other disease known to alter metabolism; those with \nuncontrolled hypertension (≥160/100 mmHg), uncontrolled diabetes (blood glucose >β50 mg/dl), \nheart disease, kidney disease, allergies to milk protein; those participating in a regular exercise \nprogram (RT>1 time per week or aerobic exercise >2 times per week); those treated with \npharmacologic doses of vitamin D or anabolic steroids were not able to participate in the study. \nIn addition, all participants must have been at least 3 months post-surgery and completed with \ntreatment (2 months) in order to participate. \n \n3.4 Data collection—laboratory visit 1 \n Once participants had been screened and given an orientation to the study via the \ntelephone (Telephone interview-Appendix B) and met the initial requirements of the study, they \nwere invited to the Clinical Exercise Physiology Laboratory at The Florida State University for a \n\n47 \n \nfurther orientation to the study. During the orientation visit, the study coordinator reviewed the \ntime commitment and explained the study protocol (Informed Consent-Appendix C). Participants \nwere given the opportunity to ask questions. If the participant was interested in participating in \nthe study, she completed an informed consent and was given a physician’s consent form to get \ncompleted by her physician for approval to participate in study (Physician’s Consent-Appendix \nD). Questionnaires on demographics and medical history were also completed at this time \n(Screening Questionnaires-Appendix E). Once eligibility was confirmed, physician’s consent \nreceived, and the participant had consented to participate, the participant was scheduled for her \nfirst testing visit. \n Prior to all laboratory testing, the participants were asked to refrain from alcohol or \nexercise for 24 hours. During the first testing visit participants came to the laboratory after an \novernight fast (>8 hours). Blood pressure and heart rate was measured in a quiet room on the \nbrachial and radial artery respectively, after the participants had been seated for a period of 5 \nminutes. Fasting blood draws were taken from a forearm vein in the amount of 20 milliliters by a \ntrained phlebotomist to measure insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) as an anabolic marker of \nmuscle metabolism, adiponectin as a marker of fat metabolism, human C-reactive protein (CRP) \nas a measure of systemic inflammation. Due to the scope of this study, these particular \nbiomarkers were chosen in order to understand possible mechanisms for the influence of RT and \nprotein on muscle and fat in BCS. The whole blood was then centrifuged (4oC for 15 min @ \n3500 RPM) and serum was separated into individual aliquots and frozen at -80oC. All blood \nsamples were analyzed at the",
    "conclusion": "of the intervention at 12 weeks using commercially \navailable ELISA kits (R&D Systems®) that were run in duplicate. Following the blood draw, \nheight and weight was assessed using a standardized scale. Waist and hip circumference were \n\n48 \n \ntaken at least 2 times at the narrowest part of the waist and largest protrusion around the \nbuttocks, respectively. Body composition measurements (iDXATM, Lunar, GE) of total body, \nandroid and gynoid regions, and appendicular measures of fat-free mass and fat mass were \nassessed with the participant still fasted and laying supine on the DXA machine. Handgrip \nstrength was measured using a handgrip dynamometer (Creative Health Products, INC. Ann \nArbor, Michigan). Handgrip measurements were taken three times on each arm, and the highest \nmeasurements from each arm were added together to compute the combined handgrip score. \nBoth upper and lower body strength were assessed using the chest press and leg extension \nexercises (MedXTM, Ocala, FL), respectively. After a warm-up, participants were progressed \ntowards the maximum weight that they could lift one time (1-RM) through a full range of \nmotion. All measurements were recorded, with the goal of achieving a 1-RM within 3 to 5 \nmaximal attempts. Three-day food records (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day) were explained and \ndistributed and were collected during the second visit. \n \n3.5 Data collection—laboratory visit 2 \nOn the second visit, participants returned their 3-day dietary records and had their resting \nblood pressure and heart rate measurements repeated. Participants also had their 1-RM strength \nmeasures repeated. The highest value obtained during the 1-RM testing from either the first or \nsecond visit was the criterion measure of strength. Functionality was measured objectively via \nthe continuous scale-physical functional performance (CS-PFP) test. The CS-PFP test consists of \na series of tasks that mimic normal activities of daily living. This test has been shown to have \nconvergent, construct, and face validity for 16 everyday household tasks in previously published \nresearch with a high reproducibility (r=0.97) and sensitivity to change, as well as having an \n\n49 \n \neffect size of 0.8 (61). Furthermore, the CS-PFP test does not have ceiling or floor effects and \nthus is able to measure function in highly functional individuals as well as in functionally \nimpaired individuals that cannot perform a particular task (60). Variance is minimized by giving \nthe test under standard conditions thereby enhancing the ability to detect changes from an \nintervention. The tasks included in the CS-PFP-10 include carrying a weighted pan, putting on a \njacket, picking up scarves, reaching, floor sweeping, doing laundry, sitting and standing from the \nfloor, stair climbing, getting on and off a simulated bus, carrying groceries, and walking for 6 \nminutes. Scores range from 0-100 with 0 indicating “worst” and 100 indicating “best” and is \ndetermined by the time it takes to complete each task, the amount of weight carried, and for \nsome tasks the distance traveled. \n All measurements were repeated the week after completion of the 12-week intervention. \nIn addition, measurement of 1-RM was repeated at 6 weeks for both the training groups \n(RT+protein and RT) in order to progress RT appropriately. \n \n3.6 Diet and exercise interventions \n Upon completion of baseline testing, each participant was stratified by the principal \ninvestigator by age, lean mass, stage of cancer, and treatment as well as calcium and Vitamin D \nintake to 1 of the 2 intervention groups: 1) resistance training and protein consumption \n(RT+protein), or 2) RT alone. Stratification was performed by assigning participants to each \ngroup depending on their baseline age, lean mass, stage of cancer, type of cancer treatment, as \nwell as calcium and Vitamin D intake in order maintain similarity between the means of the two \ngroups at baseline. Both groups were given a daily pedometer and physical activity log at \nbaseline to record physical activity for 1 week (randomly selected) out of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd \n\n50 \n \nmonth of the study (Appendix F). It was anticipated that several of the participants were calcium \nand/or vitamin D supplement users; therefore we asked them to maintain their normal calcium \nand/or vitamin D intake and to monitor their daily intake via a calcium and vitamin D log. \nParticipants that were not consuming supplemental calcium and vitamin D or those that were not \nconsuming a minimum of 1200mg of calcium and 800IU of vitamin D were asked to consume a \ndaily calcium and vitamin D supplement (Member’s Mark ™) that we provided to reach the \nminimum dosage for the duration of the 12-week intervention. \nFor the length of the 12 weeks, the RT+protein group was instructed to consume 2 \nservings of a ready to drink (RTD) protein (serving size is 340 ml: 140 kcals, 1.0 g fat, 12.0 g \ncarbohydrate, 20 g protein; Supreme Protein®, Dymatize Enterprises, LLC, Dallas, TX), for a \ntotal of 40 g of protein daily from the supplement. The rationale for choosing this dose of protein \nwas that it is well tolerated by participants on a daily basis, and positively influenced body \ncomposition in non-malignant overweight middle-aged to older adults (10, 12). In addition, this \nextra protein was intended to have participants in the protein group consuming >20% protein \nwhich appears to be beneficial for BCS (197). The women in the RT+protein group consumed \nthe first 20 g serving of protein within 30 minutes of completing each RT session on training \ndays and in the morning before breakfast on the non-training days. The women consumed the \nsecond 20 g serving of protein as their last meal consumed within 30 minutes of going to bed on \nall days of the week. The participants in the RT+protein group were advised to adjust their food \nintake to account for the additional energy from the protein supplement but not to make any \nchanges to their diet. Additionally, the RT+protein and RT groups completed 12 weeks of a \nsupervised RT program. \n\n51 \n \nProtein change, which is the change in habitual protein intake, was determined according \nto the calculations of Bosse and Dixon (23) as: \nChange in habitual protein intake = [((g / kg / day intake during study – g / kg / day \nintake at baseline) / g / kg / day intake at baseline) x 100] \nFurthermore, the protein spread, which is the % difference in protein intake between \nexperimental and control group was also calculated using the formula from Bosse and Dixon \n(23) as: \nBetween group % spread in protein intake = [((higher protein group g / kg / day intake \nduring study control group g / kg / day intake during study) / control group g / kg / day \nintake during study) x 100] \nTraining was completed under the supervision of qualified graduate and undergraduate exercise \nscience students on 2 non-consecutive days each week for 12 weeks. Participants performed 2 \nsets of 10 repetitions and a 3rd set to muscular exhaustion for the upper and lower body as \npreviously described (195). Intensity began at 65% of each participant's 1-RM and slowly \nprogressed to an intensity not exceeding 85% of the most recent 1-RM throughout the 12 weeks. \nAll exercise sessions were carefully monitored and recorded by the exercise instructors. Exercise \nmachines included the MedXTM chest press, leg press, leg extension, biceps curl, and triceps \npress down, overhead military press, seated row, leg curl, abdominal crunch, and lower back \nextension. The rationale for using the proposed intensities was that body composition \nimprovements have been reported using intensities within this range (131, 274). The \nprescription for the RT program followed the guidelines recommended by the American College \nof Sports Medicine (92). \n \n\n52 \n \n3.7 Participant recruitment, retention, and compliance \n BCS (stages 0-III) with diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, including African \nAmericans, Asians, and Hispanics who live in Tallahassee metropolitan and rural areas within \nreasonable commuting distances were recruited via flyers, feature stories, science articles, as \nwell as oncologist and health specialists and local breast cancer support groups and events. \n To achieve our specific aims, participant retention and compliance was a top priority. We \nprovided incentives and small gifts via raffles every week (e.g. gift cards to local merchants). We \ncollected empty protein containers for the RT+protein group and calcium/vitamin D containers \nfor both groups to verify compliance every 2 weeks. Furthermore, we asked participants in the \nRT+protein group to complete a daily protein log to further record compliance to consuming the \nprotein supplement. Compliance to RT sessions was recorded by the exercise trainer scheduled \nto conduct the weekly exercise sessions. Participants who missed an exercise session were called \nto remind them of their next appointment and were scheduled for a make-up session. \n \n3.8 Anticipated risks and solutions \nAll participants needed medical clearance from their oncologist or primary care \nphysicians verifying that they did not fall within the exclusionary criteria for the study. At any \ntime during the study, participants who did not meet the inclusion criteria were not able to \ncontinue with the study. Potential physical risks to participants in this study were minimized by \nusing only skilled technicians in testing and intervention procedures. All personnel involved in \nthe study were CPR and First Aid Certified. If participants expressed significant fatigue or did \nnot feel comfortable with testing procedures, the test was not completed at that time. If at any \ntime a participant experienced chest pain or had any signs or symptoms of dizziness or had any \n\n53 \n \nabnormal blood pressure or heart rate response to testing or training, emergency personnel were \ncontacted. Participants engaging in RT and testing have the risk of experiencing muscle soreness. \nCare was taken to minimize soreness by slowly progressing participants through the RT \nintervention and thoroughly stretching after RT and testing sessions. Qualified graduate and \nundergraduate exercise instructors oversaw all exercise sessions in order to ensure proper \nexercise techniques and to monitor exercise intensity. There are little data on the injury rates in \nstrength training. Our previous experience with strength testing and training in older individuals \nindicates that the musculoskeletal injury rate is low during RT. The injury rate may be higher \nduring strength testing, but the risk in the present study was kept low by careful warm-up and \nslow progression. The risk of any cardiovascular complication during strength testing and \ntraining is also low. Participants in the RT groups were taught the proper exercise techniques to \nminimize any injury that may occur from the training procedures. In case of emergency, \nemergency personnel were available within five minutes on the university campus. \nLymphedema, which is defined as the swelling in one or more of the limbs as a result of \nthe blockage in the lymphatic system prevents the adequate draining of lymph fluid in the \naffected limb. Breast cancer patients and BCS that have had damage or removal of one of more \nlymph nodes due to surgery or radiation treatment are at risk for developing lymphedema. The \naccumulation of fluid causes swelling in the affected arm and can result in pain, discomfort and \nskin discoloration. There is no cure for lymphedema, but it can be controlled through manual \nlymph drainage via therapeutic massage, wearing compression garments and exercise. For many \nyear, clinical practice instructed BCS with or at risk of developing lymphedema to refrain from \nlifting more than 15 lbs of weight with the affected limbs including performing upper body \nexercise, believing that this would exacerbate the lymphedema. However, recent evidence \n\n54 \n \nsuggests the contrary as moderate intensity exercise has been shown not to cause or exacerbate \nlymphedma (4, 168). In a 6-month BCS study by Simonavice et al. (2014), none of the \nparticipants developed lymphedema, participants’ arm circumferences were measured every β \nweeks for the duration of the study (248). Nevertheless, in order to ensure safety participants in \nthe RT groups were monitored monthly via arm circumference measurements. Circumference \nmeasurements were taken every 3 cm on each arm beginning at the styloid process of the ulna \nand continued 45 cm proximally. An increase in arm circumference of >2 cm at one of the \nlandmarks was an indication of swelling and therefore we reduced of the prescribed RT intensity. \nFurthermore, if the participants that experienced any signs of symptoms of lymphedema \nincluding swelling in the upper extremities, shoulders, or chest; a heavy sensation in the arms; \nskin tightness or discoloration and reduced flexibility in the hand or wrist were asked to notify \nthe principal investigator and exercise intensity was decreased accordingly and participants were \nreferred to their physician or oncologist. Participants that had or were at risk of developing \nlymphedema were encouraged to wear their compression garments during the RT exercise \nsessions. \nThe potential for weight gain is possible for participants consuming the extra calories \nfrom protein, however, based on their dietary logs, recommendations were given on how to \nbalance energy intake and body weight was measured at every session. \nAdverse events could include those associated with DXA, which involves a low exposure \nto radiation (<5 mrem per DXA scan). Doses received from DXA scans examinations are small \nin comparison to other common radiation sources and are believed to represent no significant \nhealth risk. By comparison, natural background radiation is about 300 mrem per year, an x-ray of \n\n55 \n \nthe spine is 70 mrem, a mammogram is 45 mrem, and a typical cross-country plane flight is \napproximately 6 mrem of radiation. \nThere is some risk associated with the blood draw, particularly local bruising, tenderness, \nand infection. This was minimized by using only trained phlebotomists and sterile techniques. \nOnly one adverse event occurred and forms were used to report the details. This adverse \nevent was not related to the exercise or the protein, nevertheless it was reported to the PI who \nthen informed the IRB. There were no unanticipated adverse events. In the absence of moderate \nor serious adverse events, as is appropriate with minimal risk studies, reports of study progress \nwere submitted to the IRB for review on a quarterly basis. \nAll data and samples collected were coded numerically and results kept confidential \nthroughout the course of the study. The master sheet of codes and questionnaires obtained were \nretained by the PI and kept in a locked cabinet in a locked room in the Department of Nutrition, \nFood and Exercise Sciences after completion of the research project. Results of this study will be \npublished and/or presented at meetings but no names, initials, or other identifying characteristics \nwill be reported. Medical records will be maintained in strictest confidence according to current \nlegal requirements and will not be revealed unless required by law. \n \n3.9 Stopping signal \nIf participants acquired any of the exclusion criteria during the course of the study they \nwere not be able to continue with the study and were referred to their primary care physicians \nand/or oncologists. \n \n \n\n56 \n \n3.10 Statistical analyses \nDescriptive statistics were calculated for all variables and included means and standard \ndeviations for normally distributed continuous variables and medians, minima and maxima for \nnon-normally distributed continuous variables. Frequency and percentages were calculated for \ncategorical variables. Distributions of outcome variables examined graphically for symmetry and \nfor outliers. Extreme outliers were investigated to determine whether there were any technical or \nclerical errors and if such outliers were not attributed to technical or clerical error, it was \nincluded in the analysis The primary aim of this study was to investigate the ability of RT and \nprotein, individually, and in combination to improve body composition, muscular strength, \nphysical function and metabolic biomarkers of muscle and fat metabolism in a stratified \nrandomized controlled clinical trial in post-menopausal BCS. Dependent variables at baseline \nwere analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, and when group differences in baseline variables \nwere observed, an analysis of covariance was performed with the baseline variable as the \ncovariate. Dependent variables were analyzed by a 2 by 2 factorial analysis of variance (group x \ntime) with repeated measures on the last factor. When interactions were significant, ANOVAs \nwere used to compare between group values as well as pre and posttest values within groups. All \nsignificance was accepted at p≤0.05. All analyses were performed using the SPSS (v.21) \nstatistical package (IBM®, Armonk, New York). An intention-to-treat analysis was used to \nevaluate pre and posttest scores to address the effects of the interventions on all randomized \nparticipants regardless of whether they completed the study or not. Using the principle of last \nobservation carried forward, missing posttest scores was filled using the test scores that were \ncollected closest to the time of dropout. Pearson product moment correlations were completed on \nvariables of strength, body composition, dietary intake and the blood biomarkers. \n\n57 \n \nCHAPTER 4 \nRESULTS \n4.1 Participants \nA total of 57 BCS responded to recruitment efforts for the present study. Of these, 10 \ndeclined to participate upon receiving a detailed description of the commitments of the study, \nand 13 did not meet the eligibility requirements for the study for one of the following reasons: \ncurrently participating in a vigorous exercise program (n=2) or still undergoing primary \ntreatment (n=11). Of the 34 participants that gave consent, one did not complete baseline testing \nas a result of the time commitment of the study. Therefore, 33 were stratified randomly by age, \nlean mass, stage of cancer, type of cancer treatment, and calcium and vitamin D supplementation \ninto one of the two intervention groups: 1) resistance training and protein consumption \n(RT+protein), or 2) RT alone. Seventeen women were assigned to the RT+protein group of these \none did not complete the RT intervention during the 6th week due to medical complications not \nrelated to cancer. Additionally, one participant in the RT+protein group did not complete her \nsecond day of post-testing visit due to unforeseen family emergency that arose after the first day \nof post-testing visit. The remaining 16 women were assigned to the RT alone group, with 13 of \nthese participants completing the entire intervention. One of the women could not return for her \nsecond day of post-testing due to travel conflicts, one woman dropped out during the 7th week of \nthe intervention because of the time commitment, and the other participant was unable to \ncontinue due to medical complications unrelated to the study. However, as an intent-to-treat \nanalysis was the main statistical goal of the study, all 17 women in the RT+protein group and all \n16 women in the RT group were included in the analyses. An outline of the participant flow from \nrecruitment to analysis is displayed in Figure 4. \n\n58 \n \n \nFigure 4.

Thirty-two of the \nwomen in this study were Caucasian and one woman was African-American. The overall \naverage age of the women in the study was 59 ± 8 years, ranging from 40-74 years. The average \nBMI of all the women was 27.2 ± 5.6 kg/m2 with 33% (n=11) being classified as overweight and \n27% (n=9) being classified as obese with a range from 20.9 to 44.1 kg/m2. Furthermore, based on \ntheir average baseline pedometer steps of 6,286 ± 2,734 steps/day (range from 2,278 to13,421 \nsteps/day) the women in this study would be described as low activity individuals. The \nparticipants in both groups shared similar menopausal ages of 50 ± 4 years in the RT+protein \ngroup and 47 ± 6 years in the RT group, with 50% (n=8) and 59 % (n=10) of the women in the \nRT+protein and RT groups respectively entering early menopause induced by cancer treatment. \nThe history of cancer diagnosis was also similar between both groups with the RT+protein and \nRT groups being 76.1 ± 55.3 and 73.9 ± 65.2 months respectively since primary diagnosis for \nbreast cancer. The distribution of cancer diagnosis within the RT+protein group was fairly \nbalanced with 24% (n=4), 29% (n=5), 18% (n=3) and 29% (n=5) being diagnosed with stages 0, \nI, II, and III breast cancer, respectively. Whereas, in the RT group 50% (n=8) of the women were \ndiagnosed with Stage I breast cancer and the remaining stages 0, II and III each had 18% (n=3) \nof the women in the RT group. However, there were no statistically significant differences in \nstage of breast cancer diagnosis between the two intervention groups. \nSimilarly, both groups did not differ in time since completion of primary cancer treatment \nwhich, included surgery, chemotherapy, radiation or a combination of these, nor did they differ \nin time since completion of hormone therapy for those who had hormone therapy. The \nRT+protein group was 70.5 ± 55.5 months from completion of primary treatment, with 59% \n(n=10) of the women having received chemotherapy and 53% (n=9) having received radiation. \n\n60 \n \nTable 1.

In the same manner, the RT group was 68.3 ± 66.4 \nmonths from completion of primary treatment, with 44% (n=7) of the women having received \n\n61 \n \nchemotherapy and 50.0% (n=8) having received radiation. In addition, 13% (n=2) had completed \nhormone therapy 101.0 ± 111.7 months prior to beginning of the study and 25% (n=4) were \ncurrently receiving hormone therapy during the study. Furthermore, 65% of the women in the \nRT+protein group (n=11) and 63% of women in RT group (n=10) were currently supplementing \nwith either calcium bicarbonate or citrate. Among the six women in the RT+protein group not \nconsuming a regular daily calcium supplement, we assigned our 1200 mg calcium supplement to \nthree of them, one participant was consuming less than 1200 mg and agreed to increase the daily \ndose of her own calcium to reach 1200 mg and two participants were advised by their physicians \nnot to supplement with calcium. Additionally, of the six participants in the RT group not \nconsuming a daily calcium supplement, three women agreed to consume our 1200 mg \nsupplement, two women preferred to consume their own calcium and agreed to consume a \nminimum of 1200 mg, and one participant was consuming less than 1200 mg refused to increase \nthe dose of her calcium supplement from 310 mg to 1200 mg. In addition, 88% of the \nparticipants in RT+protein group (n=15) and 75% of the participants in the RT group (n=12) \nwere consuming a vitamin D supplement at baseline. The two women in the RT+protein group \nnot consuming a minimum of 800 IU on a regular basis, one met this requirement by consuming \nour vitamin D supplement, and the other agreed to consume her own vitamin D supplement. \nSimilarly, three women in the RT group agreed to consume our 800 IU vitamin D supplement \nand one participant in the RT group preferred to consume her own daily vitamin D supplement. \nHowever, at baseline the amount of supplemental calcium was similar between the RT+protein \nand RT groups (1239.3 ± 362.6 vs. 1202.3 ± 439.6 mg/day) as was the daily dose of vitamin D \n(1828.1 ± 1219.8 vs. 1671.4 ± 631.8 IU/day).

The women \nperformed their RT training sessions two days per week and the total adherence for all the \nparticipants in both groups including those that did not complete the intervention was 89.7 ± \n19.7%. During each exercise session the participants performed 2 sets of 10 repetitions and a 3rd \nset to muscular exhaustion on 10 exercises performed in a superset design in which the women \nperformed a set on an upper body machine and with no rest performed a consecutive set on a \nlower body machine until three sets on each machine was completed before continuing to the \nnext pairing of upper and lower body exercises. The exercises were performed on MedXTM \nmachines in the following order: chest press paired with the leg extension, seated row with a \nseated leg curl, triceps press down with the leg press, biceps curl with the abdominal crunch and \nthe overhead military press with 45º lower back extension. Exercise intensity began at 65 ± 2% \nand 64 ± 2% of each participant's 1-RM for the chest press and leg extension machines \nrespectively, and the starting weights for the remaining exercises were estimated based on each \nparticipant’s 1-RM for the chest press and leg extension. Training load on each exercise was \nincreased at the beginning of each new week based on the number of repetitions performed \nduring each participant’s γrd set to muscular exhaustion on each exercise on their last training \nsession the previous week. Thus, for every 2 repetitions performed past 10 repetitions in their 3rd \nset to muscular exhaustion the weight was increased by 1.81kg (4lbs) on the MedXTM machines. \nIn addition, if the participant was able to complete 10 repetitions in their 3rd set to muscular \nexhaustion the weight was also increased by 1.81kg (4lbs) the following week in order to ensure \nparticipants progressed each week. The weight was maintained on the exercises that participants \n\n63 \n \nwere unable to perform 10 repetitions on their 3rd set to muscular exhaustion during their last \ntraining session of the week. The total training volume over the 12 weeks was calculated by \nmultiplying the weight lifted by the number of repetitions performed for each set for each week \n(weight lifted x repetitions x sets) and was statistically similar between the groups. The total \nweight lifted over the 12 weeks for the RT+protein and RT groups were 486,550 ± 140,402 kg \nand 405,028 ± 135,685 kg respectively. In addition, the total weight lifted over the 12 weeks for \nthe upper body exercises was 227,673 ± 65,732 kg for the RT+protein group and 185,760 ± \n62,932 kg for the RT group and was approaching significance (F(1,31)=3.492, p= 0.071). \nHowever, the total weight lifted for the lower body exercises over the 12 weeks was not \nstatistically different between the RT+protein and RT groups (258,877 ± 75,997 kg vs. 219,274 ± \n73,906 kg). Furthermore, the 1-RM for the chest press and leg extension were repeated after 6 \nweeks of training therefore training intensity for weeks 1-6 of training was calculated as a \npercentage of their baseline 1-RM while training intensity for weeks 7-12 was calculated as a \npercentage of their 6-week (mid-study) 1-RM for chest press and leg extension. The exercise \nintensity for the chest press and leg extension machines was used to represent upper and lower \nbody intensity respectively, over the 12-week RT intervention. The overall average intensity for \nboth groups over the 12 weeks was 78 ± 9% of baseline 1-RM for upper body intensity and 75 ± \n9% of baseline 1-RM for lower body intensity. Table 2 displays the exercise intensity and \nadherence between the two groups. During weeks 1-6 the average upper body and lower body \nexercise intensity for both groups was 70 ± 5% and 69 ± 5% of baseline 1-RM respectively and \nprogressed to 76 ± 7% and 81 ± 9% of their 6 week 1-RM during weeks 7-12. There were no \nsignificant differences between exercise intensity between the RT+protein and RT groups during \nweeks 1-6 for upper body (70 ± 7% vs. 71 ± 4%) and lower body (69 ± 5% vs. 70 ± 6%) percent \n\n64 \n \nof baseline 1-RM. Similarly, exercise intensity did not differ between the RT+protein and RT \ngroups during weeks 7-12 for upper body (77 ± 7% vs. 75 ± 8%) and lower body (80 ± 9% vs. \n83 ± 9%) percent of the 6-week 1-RM. \nExercise adherence was calculated by taking a percentage of attendance to the 24 RT \ntraining sessions during the 12-week intervention. The average of adherence to RT sessions of all \nthe participants (N=33) including those that dropped out (n=3) did not statistically differ between \nthe two groups, with the RT+protein group being 92.4 ± 18.8% (n=17) adherent and the RT \ngroup attending 86.8 ± 20.9% (n=16) of their RT sessions. Among only the participants that \ncompleted the exercise intervention (N=30), the average exercise adherence for both groups was \n95 ± 9%, and was similar between the groups with the RT+protein group (n=16) attending 97 ± \n7% of the RT sessions and the RT group (n=14) attending 94 ± 10% RT sessions. Furthermore, \nadherence to intake of the daily protein supplement averaged 91 ± 9% for the RT+protein group. \nThe participants in both groups were asked to maintain their normal intake of calcium and \nvitamin D supplements and adherence was calculated from their daily supplement logs. Of the 17 \nwomen in RT+protein group, two participants were advised by their physicians not to consume \nany supplemental calcium but were already consuming vitamin D at baseline therefore we did \nnot provide them with any calcium supplements and asked them to maintain their vitamin D \nintake. Therefore, in the RT+protein group we provided our daily calcium (1200 mg) and \nvitamin D (800 IU) supplement to four women and three women increased their own calcium \nand vitamin D supplements to meet the minimum for the duration of the study. The remaining 11 \nwomen in the RT+protein group were already consuming a minimum of 1200 mg of calcium and \n800 IU at the beginning of the study and were asked to maintain their current dose. \n \n\n65 \n \n Table 2.

One participant in the RT group was consuming 310 mg and preferred \nnot to increase her calcium intake. The remaining 10 participants in the RT group maintained \ntheir daily calcium and vitamin D intake that they were consuming at baseline. Twenty-six \nwomen returned their calcium and vitamin D logs and there was a significant difference between \n\n66 \n \nthe groups in adherence of consuming their daily supplements. The average adherence of the \nwomen in the RT+protein group (n=16) was 94 ± 6% while the women in the RT group (n=10) \nhad an average adherence of 84 ± 19% (F(1,24) =4.259, p≤0.05). \n \n4.3 Muscular strength, physical activity and function \nThe intensity of the 12-week RT intervention was sufficient to elicit significant \nimprovements in handgrip strength, 1-RM chest press and 1-RM leg extension and physical \nfunction. All participants were able to complete all strength testing with the exception of one \nparticipant in the RT+protein group who was not able to successfully perform the baseline 1-RM \nleg extension due to pain in the anterior portion of her lower leg from peripheral neuropathy. \nTherefore, she did not have baseline and 12-week measurements for 1-RM leg extension. She did \nhowever perform the leg extension as part of the RT intervention, but at a low amount of weight. \nAt baseline the women in the RT+protein and RT groups had similar handgrip and 1-RM chest \npress strength values, however the 1-RM leg extension strength was significantly greater in the \nRT+Protein group compared to the RT group at baseline (105.2 ± 24.4 kg vs. 88.1 ± 23.4 kg; \nF(1,30)=4.103, p= 0.052). Therefore, an analysis of covariance was completed for the analysis of \nleg extension strength. The analysis of covariance revealed that when the baseline 1-RM leg \nextension was normalized at 96.8kg, there was no significant difference in the adjusted means at \n12 weeks (means ± standard errors; RT+protein: 118.6 ± 3.11 vs. RT: 111.9 ± 3.11 kg; p=0.480). \nThere was no group by time interactions for 1-RM chest press, however a group by time effect \nfor handgrip strength was approaching significance (F(1,31) =3.538, p= 0.069, ES=0.102). \nSignificant time effects were observed for handgrip strength (F(1,31) =20.772, p≤0.05, ES=0.401), \n1-RM chest press (F(1,31) =93.496, p≤0.05, ES=0.751) and 1-RM leg extension (F(1,30) =87.205, \n\n67 \n \np≤0.05, ES=0.744). The improvements in all measures of muscular strength from baseline to 12 \nweeks are displayed in Table 3. The RT+Protein group significantly improved handgrip strength, \n1-RM chest press, and 1-RM leg extension by 4%, 32% and 23% respectively from baseline to \n12 weeks. Likewise, the RT group increased their handgrip strength, 1-RM chest press, and 1-\nRM leg extension by 9%, 39% and 17% respectively from baseline to 12 weeks. In order, to \nensure the aforementioned improvements were due to the RT intervention, the participants were \nasked to maintain their regular physical activity levels for the duration of the 12-week \nintervention. \nTheir physical activity levels were determined by the average daily steps measured \nduring one week at baseline, and again for one random week during the second and third months \nof the study via a pedometer. Physical activity levels were not significantly different between the \nRT+protein and RT groups at baseline (5,945 ± 2,777 vs. 6,700 ± 2,724 steps/day), at 4 weeks \n(5,433 ± 1,896 vs. 6,790 ± 2,533 steps/day) and at 12 weeks (5,395 ± 2,027 vs. 5,912 ± 3,300 \nsteps/day). There were no significant group by time or time effects observed in physical activity \nlevels. \nPhysical function as measured objectively by Continuous Scale-Physical Functional \nPerformance and a total function score of 57 or higher indicates a physical reserve that is \nassociated with a greater ability to live independently. The average total physical function did \nnot differ between the two groups at baseline. However, at baseline 3 women in the RT+protein \ngroup and 2 women in the RT group had a total function score below 57 units. Of these 5 \nwomen, only one from each group completed the intervention and post-testing. The participant in \nthe RT+protein group increased her total function score from 51 to 58 during the 12-week \n\n68 \n \nintervention whereas the participant in the RT group improved her total function score from 45 \nto 52 and thus was still below the functional threshold. \n \nTable 3.

Over the 12-week RT \n\n69 \n \nintervention, the BCS significantly improved upper body strength by 7% (F(1,31) =7.967, p≤0.05, \nES=0.204), lower body strength by 10% (F(1,31) =22.612, p≤0.05, ES=0.422), balance and \ncoordination by 4% (F(1,31) =8.982, p≤0.05, ES=0.225), endurance by 4% (F(1,31) =9.656, p≤0.05, \nES=0.238) and total function by 5% (F(1,31) =18.512, p≤0.05, ES=0.374). Table 3 displays the \ncomparison between the RT+protein and RT groups in the measures of physical function at \nbaseline and 12 weeks. \n \n4.4 Body composition \nThe comparison of anthropometric and body composition measurements are detailed in \nTable 4. The anthropometric measures of body weight and BMI were not different between the \ngroups and did not change over the 12-week intervention. The BMI of the women in the study \nranged from 20.9 to 44.1 kg/m² at baseline and remained similar at 12 weeks (21.2 to 45.3 \nkg/m²). Similarly, waist and hip girth measures as well as the waist to hip ratios did not differ at \nbaseline. At baseline, the waist circumference for all the women averaged of 85.6 ± 13.6 cm and \nranged from 65.4 to 118.9 cm with eight women in the RT+protein group and four women in the \nRT group having a waist circumference greater than 88 cm. Although there were no group by \ntime interactions in the girth measurements, there were significant time effects observed for \nwaist (F(1,31) =17.436, p≤0.05, ES=0.360) and hip (F(1,31) =7.019, p≤0.05, ES=0.185) girth, and \nthus waist to hip ratio (F(1,31) =9.523, p≤0.05, ES=0.235). However, only one participant in the \nRT+protein had a decrease in waist circumference from 89.3 to 81.2 cm. The remaining seven \nparticipants in the RT+protein group and the four participants in the RT group with waist \ncircumferences greater than 88 cm did not reduce their waist circumferences below 88 cm. There \nwere no significant differences at baseline in measures of total body lean and fat mass, lean to fat \n\n70 \n \nmass ratio, arms and legs lean mass, the ASMI, total and regional body fat percent and BMD as \nmeasured by DXA. Total body lean mass and total body fat percent at baseline ranged from 25.4 \nto 52.4 kg and 30.0 to 52.8% respectively. In addition, the ASMI ranged from 4.68 to 10.66 \nkg/m² at baseline and one participant from the RT+protein group and one from the RT group had \nan ASMI that fell below the sarcopenic threshold (<5.45 kg/m²). Neither participant increased \nher ASMI above the sarcopenic threshold at the end of the 12-week RT intervention. There were \nno group by time interactions in all measures of body composition with the exception of the lean \nmass of the arms (F(1,31) =4.493, p≤0.05, ES=0.127). The lean mass of the arms increased to a \ngreater extent in the RT+protein group (8%) compared to the RT group (2%) from baseline to 12 \nweeks. Similar to the anthropometric measurements, there were significant time effects observed \nfor total body lean (F(1,31) =27.416, p≤0.05, ES=0.469) and fat mass (F(1,31) =6.012, p≤0.05, \nES=0.162), lean to fat mass ratio (F(1,31) =17.856, p≤0.05, ES=0.γ65), arms’ (F(1,31) =15.396, \np≤0.05, ES=0.γγβ) and legs’ (F(1,31) =21.269, p≤0.05, ES=0.407) lean mass, the ASMI (F(1,31) \n=39.588, p≤0.05, ES=0.561), total body fat percentage (F(1,31) =23.366, p≤0.05, ES=0.430) as \nwell as android (F(1,31) =6.788, p≤0.05, ES=0.180) and gynoid (F(1,31) =24.746, p≤0.05, \nES=0.444) body fat percent. Therefore, both the RT+protein and RT groups observed similar \nsignificant changes in total body lean (3% vs. 2%) and fat mass (-2% vs. -2%), lean to fat mass \nratio (5% vs. 4%), legs lean mass (2% vs. 3%), the ASMI (4% vs. 3%), total body fat percentage \n(-1% vs. -1%) as well as android (-1% vs. -1%) and gynoid (-1% vs. -1%) body fat percent from \nbaseline to 12 weeks. There were no time effects for total body BMD observed during the 12-\nweek RT intervention. \n \n \n\n71 \n \nTable 4.

The only exception would be an expected \nincrease in the protein, calcium and vitamin D intake of the BCS in the RT+protein as a result of \nconsuming their assigned protein supplement. At baseline, the BCS consumed an average of \n1,758 ± 517 kcal/day, ranging from 214 kcal/day to 2,707 kcal/day, with an average of 16.4 ± \n4.3% from protein (1.00 ± 0.32 g/kg/day), 46.0 ± 7.0% from carbohydrates, and 38.1 ± 5.0% \nfrom fat. Furthermore, protein intake was significantly correlated with percent body fat (r=-\n0.502) and lean to fat mass ratio (r=0.487) at baseline. The protein intake based on the three-day \ndietary food recall at baseline of all the women ranged from 0.10 g/kg/day to 1.82 g/kg/day (7% \nto 27 % of total calories from protein), with three women from the RT+protein group and five \nwomen from the RT group consuming less than the RDA for protein (0.8 g/kg/day). Five women \nfrom each group were consuming more than the recommended intake for aging adults (1.14 \ng/kg/day) and only one participant from the RT group was consuming more than the recently \nrecommended intake of 1.4-1.6 g/kg/day). \nThe range of protein intake for all the BCS remained similar (0.10 g/kg/day to 1.89 \ng/kg/day) at 12 weeks, however no women in the RT+protein group consumed less than the \nRDA for protein whereas, five women in the RT group consumed less than the RDA, four of \nwhom did not at baseline and thus reduced their protein intake during the 12-week intervention. \nAt 12 weeks, 10 participants from the RT+protein group were consuming more than 1.14 \ng/kg/day, with six of those consuming more than 1.4 g/kg/day. Whereas, three women from the \n\n73 \n \nRT group were consuming greater than 1.14 g/kg/day of protein at 12 weeks, two who consumed \nless than 0.8 g/kg/day at baseline and therefore increased their protein intake. \nThe comparison of dietary intake between the RT+protein and RT groups is displayed in \nTable 5. At baseline there were no significant differences in total caloric intake (kcal/d) between \nthe RT+protein (1,843.6 ± 473.1 kcal/d) and the RT (1,660.2 ± 563.0 kcal/d) groups, in addition \nthere were no differences between the groups in the intake of dietary protein (g/d), carbohydrate \n(g/d) and fat (g/d), as well as dietary and supplemental calcium (mg/d), dietary vitamin D (IU). \nThere were significant time effects observed for changes from baseline to 6 weeks in total \ncalories consumed (F(1,30) = 4.593, p≤0.05, ES=0.133), protein intake in grams per day (F(1,30) = \n6.594, p≤0.05, ES=0.180) and percent of total calories (F(1,30) = 23.485, p≤0.05, ES=0.439), \ncarbohydrate intake (g/d) (F(1,30) = 7.584, p≤0.05, ES=0.202), fat intake (% of total caloric \nintake) (F(1,30) = 7.449, p≤0.05, ES=0.199). However, there were no significant group by time \ninteractions for changes in total caloric intake, as well as protein, carbohydrate, and fat intake \n(g/d and % of total caloric intake) at 6 weeks. The protein intake in grams per day did increase to \na greater extent from baseline to 6 weeks in the RT+protein group (72.1 ± 12.5 g/d to 91.5 ± 27.8 \ng/d) compared to the RT group (70.8 ± 29.4g/d to 77.6 ± 37.0 g/d) but was not statistically \ndifferent. In addition, percent of total calories from protein at 6 weeks was similar between the \nRT+protein and RT groups (21.4 ± 3.8 vs. 20.1 ± 6.4%). These results suggest that from baseline \nto 6 weeks the changes in protein intake occurred in contrast to our expectations. In addition \nthere were no significant time or group by time interactions in any of the dietary variables from 6 \nweeks to 12 weeks. However, the changes from baseline to 12 weeks did increase as we \nanticipated. As a result of the daily supplemental protein provided to the RT+protein group there \nwas a significant group by time interaction (F(1,30) =4.529, p≤0.05, ES=0.131) for the percent of \n\n74 \n \ntotal caloric intake coming from protein with the women in the RT+protein group increasing \ntheir protein intake (% of total caloric intake) from 16.2 ± 3.9 to 21.2 ± 4.2% compared to the \nwomen in the RT group who maintained their protein intake (% of total caloric intake) from \nbaseline to 12 weeks (16.6 ± 4.9 to 17.3 ± 6.5%). There was also a significant time effect for \nchanges in protein intake (% of total caloric intake) (F(1,30) =8.178, p≤0.05, ES=0.214). There \nwas no significant time effect for changes in protein intake in grams per day (g/d) but it was \napproaching significance (p=0.083) for a group by time interaction for protein intake with the \nRT+protein increasing their intake of protein from baseline to 12 weeks (72.1 ± 12.5 to 89.7 ± \n14.7 g/d) compared to the RT group (70.8 ± 29.4 to 69.3 ± 36.2 g/d). At 12 weeks the protein \nintake for the RT+protein group was significantly greater than the RT only group (89.7 ± 14.7 \ng/d vs. 69.3 ± 36.2 g/d, respectively; F(1,30) =4.576, p≤0.05). The protein spread (% difference in \nprotein intake between experimental and control group) at 12 weeks was 29.4%. Bosse & Dixon \n(23) reported that a protein spread of at least 66.1% has been observed in those studies that \nreported group differences between the groups consuming and not consuming protein during an \nRT intervention. However, since we did not observe any group by time interactions in protein \nintake from baseline to 6 weeks and considering both groups actually increased protein intake \nduring the first 6 weeks of the intervention, we decided to take the average of the 6-week and 12-\nweek three-day logs to determine whether the RT+protein group actually consumed significantly \nmore protein compared to the RT only group during the 12-week intervention. Further analyses \nrevealed that there were significant time effects for changes in protein intake in grams per day \n(F(1,30) =5.013, p≤0.05, ES=0.143) and percent of total calories (F(1,30) =17.613, p≤0.05, \nES=0.370) from baseline to the average of the 6-week and 12-week food logs. However, there \nwas no significant group by time effect for protein intake (g/d and % of total calories from \n\n75 \n \nprotein) from baseline to the average of the 6-week and 12-week food logs. These findings \nindicate that there was variance in the protein intake of both groups and that the supplement \nprovided to the RT+protein group did not actually significantly increase the amount of protein \nconsumed during the 12-week intervention period. This suggests that the participants in both \ngroups made changes to their habitual dietary intake during their participation in the 12-week \nintervention contrary to our instructions or they may not have accurately completed their three-\nday dietary food logs. \nThis is a possible explanation because the protein change (change in habitual protein \nintake) of the RT+protein group was an average of 27.3 ± 34.5% and ranged from -2.8% to \n143.1%. Whereas, the protein change of the RT only group averaged 5.19 ± 45.3% and ranged \nfrom -69.6% to 96.2%. Further analysis for group differences in changes in lean mass were \nperformed to only include the participants in the RT+protein group that had a protein change \ngreater than 20% (n=8) and a group by time effect that was approaching significance was \nobserved (F(1,22) =3.389, p=0.079, ES=0.133). Therefore, the RT+protein group increased lean \nmass to a greater extent when compared to the RT (+1.47kg vs. +0.68kg; p=0.079), although not \nsignificantly. However, when additional analysis for group differences in changes in lean mass \nwere performed that only included the participants in the RT+group that had a protein change \ngreater than 40% (n=4) the group by time interaction was no longer significant (p=0.617). There \nwere also no group differences when comparing those in the RT+group that had a protein change \ngreater than 40% and those in the RT group that did not have a positive protein change. Only one \nparticipant in the RT+group and two participants in the RT group achieved a protein change \nabove the recommended 59% (23). \n \n\n76 \n \nTable 5.

In \naddition, there were significant group by time (F(1,30) =30.366, p≤0.05, ES=0.503) and significant \ntime (F(1,30) =7.982, p≤0.05, ES=0.210) interactions for changes in dietary calcium intake from \nbaseline to 12 weeks with the women in the RT+protein group increasing their dietary calcium \nintake from 763 ± 179 to 1,324 ± 413 mg/d whereas, the women in the RT group decreased their \ndietary calcium intake from 900 ± 426 to 719 ± 331 mg/d. Furthermore, group by time (F(1,30) = \n8.598, p≤0.05, ES=0.223) and significant time (F(1,30) = 5.545, p≤0.05, ES=0.156) effects were \nobserved for changes in dietary vitamin D intake (IU/d) from baseline to 6 weeks.

The \nRT+protein group increased their dietary vitamin D intake from 179 ± 176 to 468 ± 244 IU/d \nwhile the RT group experienced a decrease in their intake of vitamin D from 221 ± 222 to 152 ± \n252 IU/d. \n \n4.6 Blood biomarkers \nThe comparisons between RT+protein and RT groups in baseline and 12-week \nmeasurements of the blood biomarkers of muscle (IGF-1) and fat (adiponectin) metabolism as \nwell as inflammation (CRP) are displayed in Table 6. Of the 33 women that enrolled in the \nstudy, two did not complete the 12-week intervention due to medical complications not related to \n\n78 \n \ncancer, one participant dropped out during the 7th week because of the time commitment, and \ntwo had unsuccessful post intervention blood draws. Therefore, a total of five women did not \nhave 12-week blood samples for analysis, thus 28 samples underwent analysis via ELISA. The \naverages of the duplicate samples were used for analysis. Furthermore, only samples with \ncoefficient of variation less than 20% were analyzed. Only one sample from the IGF-1 ELISA kit \nhad a coefficient of variation of 28% and was therefore dropped from analysis. The intra-assay \ncoefficients of variation for IGF-1, adiponectin, and CRP were 10.8%, 4.6%, and 2.8% \nrespectively. In addition, the inter-assay coefficients of variation for IGF-1, adiponectin, and \nCRP were 15.7%, 6.7% and 3.3% respectively. \nAt baseline, the average values for IGF-1, adiponectin and CRP for the 28 participants \nwho had serum samples analyzed were 109.6 ± 40.3 ng/mL, 12.71 ± 7.06 mg/L and 1.72 ± 1.07 \nmg/L respectively. The values for IGF-1 ranged from 41.1 ng/mL to 200.6 ng/mL at baseline, \nand all participants were within the normal ranges for IGF-1 of 40-258 ng/mL. Furthermore, the \n12-week measures of IGF-1 ranged from 46.9 ng/mL to 202.5 ng/mL and therefore remained \nwithin the normal values for IGF-1. Serum levels for adiponectin ranged from 1.35 mg/L to 32.7 \nmg/L at baseline, with two participants in the RT group above the normal range for adiponectin \nof 0.865-21.4 mg/L. The adiponectin levels ranged from 1.51 mg/L to 26.3 mg/L at 12 weeks, \nwith the same two participants remaining above the normal range of adiponectin, one of which \nmaintained her levels at 24.7 mg/L whereas, the other reduced from 32.7 mg/L to 26.2 mg/L. At \nbaseline, IGF-1 and adiponectin values were similar between the groups. However the women in \nthe RT+protein group had significantly greater CRP values than the women in the RT group \n(2.14 ± 1.17 mg/L vs. 1.24 ± 0.71 mg/L; p≤0.05) and these differences between the two groups \nremained at 12 weeks (1.91 ± 0.95 mg/L vs. 1.26 ± 0.70 mg/L; p≤0.05). The CRP values for all \n\n79 \n \nthe participants ranged from 0.246 mg/L to 4.70 mg/L, with four women in the RT+protein \ngroup that were above 3.0 mg/L which is considered a high CRP threshold although the normal \nvalues for healthy adults range from 0.109-4.29 mg/L. Of the four women above 3.0 mg/L of \nCRP, only one had a CRP value greater than 4.29 mg/L and was the only one of the four women \nthat remained above 3.0 mg/L after the 12 weeks of RT. However, one participant in the \nRT+protein group had an increase in CRP from 2.29 mg/L at baseline to 3.20 mg/L at 12 weeks. \nThere were neither time nor group by time interactions in any of the blood biomarkers with the \nexception of a significant time effect observed in IGF-1 (F(1,25) =5.631, p≤0.05, ES=0.184). The \nmean values of serum measurements of IGF-1 for both groups significantly increased from 106.2 \n± 36.8 ng/mL to 115.7 ± 34.6 ng/mL. Furthermore, at baseline CRP was negatively correlated \nwith adiponectin (r= -0.412; p≤0.05) and was positively correlated with total body weight \n(r=0.634; p≤0.01), BMI (r=0.588; p≤0.01) android body fat (r=0.509; p≤0.01), lean mass \n(r=0.565; p≤0.01), fat mass (r=0.610; p≤0.01) and total body fat % (r= 0.4ββ; p≤0.05). In \naddition, baseline values of adiponectin were negatively correlated with total body weight (r=-\n0.403; p≤0.05), BMI (r=-0.453; p≤0.05), android body fat (r=-0.538; p≤0.01), lean mass (r=-\n0.388; p≤0.05), fat mass (r=-0.376; p≤0.05). At 1β weeks, CRP no longer had a significant \npositive correlation with total body weight, lean mass and total body fat %. However, a \nsignificantly negative correlation remained between CRP and adiponectin (r=-0.503; p≤0.05), \nand CRP was still positively correlated with BMI (r=0.376; p≤0.05), android body fat (r=0.γ79; \np≤0.01), and fat mass (r=0.401; p≤0.05). Similarly, significantly negative correlations between \nadiponectin and total body weight (r=-0.467; p≤0.05), BMI (r=-0.498; p≤0.05), android body fat \n(r=-0.516; p≤0.01), lean mass (r=-0.482; p≤0.01), fat mass (r=-0.400; p≤0.05) remained at 1β \n\n80 \n \nweeks Interestingly, in contrast to baseline correlations, IGF-1 was negatively correlated with \ntotal body fat % at 12 weeks (r=-0.404; p≤0.05). \n \nTable 6.

At baseline, the RT+protein and RT groups shared similar \ncharacteristics in having history of complications with lymphedema (18% vs. 19%, respectively), \nlymph nodes removed from the right arm (41% vs. 31% respectively), lymph nodes removed \nfrom the left arm (35% vs 19% respectively) and lymph nodes removed from both arms (6% vs. \n6%, respectively). However, more women in the RT group (44%) did not have any lymph nodes \nremoved from either side compared to the number of women in the RT+protein group (18%). \n\n81 \n \n Exacerbation of lymphedema as a result of the RT in all the women participating in the \nstudy regardless of having lymph nodes removed was monitored on the first RT training session, \nand repeated during the first training sessions of week 5 and week 9 of the study. \n \nTable 7.

A positive \npercent difference indicates the involved arm had greater volume than the uninvolved and \nindicates the possibility of edema. However, a greater than 10% difference is the diagnostic \ncriteria for the presence of lymphedema. Among the participants that did not have any lymph \nnodes removed from either side of their upper body, the percent difference between the arm with \nthe larger volume and the arm with the lesser volume was analyzed. Interestingly, although less \nwomen in the RT group had any lymph nodes removed during surgery, the baseline comparison \nof the upper extremity percent difference between the involved arm and uninvolved arm was \nsignificantly (F(1,31) =4.266, p≤0.05) greater in the RT group (9.5 ± 11.2%) compared to the \nRT+protein group (1.8 ± 10.2%) as displayed in Figure 5. There was a significant group by time \n\n82 \n \ninteraction observed in percent difference between the involved arm and uninvolved arm with \nthe RT group decreasing from 9.52 ± 11.2% in week 1 to 0.18 ±7.7% in week 5 (F(2,31) =3.904 \np≤0.05, ES=0.112) whereas the RT+protein group changed from 1.82 ± 10.2% to 1.87 ± 7.4% \nfrom week 1 to week 5 of the RT intervention respectively. In addition a significant time effect \nwas also observed in percent difference between the involved arm and uninvolved arm with the \naverage difference in arm circumference of all the participants decreasing from 5.6 ± 11.2% in \nweek 1 to 1.1 ± 7.5% in week 5 and increasing to 2.0 ± 5.6% in week 9 (F(2,31) =4.177 p≤0.05, \nES=0.119)(Figure 5). Therefore, the RT intervention reduced the percent difference in volume \nbetween the involved arm and uninvolved arm in the women participating in this study and thus \ndid not exacerbate lymphedema. \n \n \n \nFigure 5.

Similar trends in difference between groups at baseline and \nchanges in measurements between weeks 1 and 5 as well as weeks 5 and 9 (Figure 6). In the \nwomen who had lymph nodes removed, those in the RT group (n=9) no longer had significantly \ngreater differences in percent arm circumference than those in the RT+protein group (n=13) (6.4 \n± 12.4% vs 2.8 ± 9.1%). There were no significant time nor group by time interactions in the \ndifferences in percent arm circumference between the involved arm and uninvolved arm. \n \n \n \nFigure 6.

The percent difference in arm circumference decreased \nsignificantly from week 1 to week 5 (F(2,31) =3.904 p≤0.05, ES=0.112) but not from weeks 5 to 9. \nOne participant experienced self-reported upper extremity swelling in the involved arm after \n\n\n84 \n \nweek 1 of the study, therefore upper body exercise intensity was reduced from the initially \nprescribed 65% to 50% of 1-RM and was slowly progressed throughout the study until week 9 \nwhen she returned to 65% of upper body 1-RM. \n \n \nFigure 7.

In fact the RT significantly \ndecreased lymphedema for those women who had higher values at baseline. The RT intervention \nsignificantly increased serum levels of IGF-1, a biomarker of muscle accretion but did not have \nan effect of serum levels of adiponectin and human CRP. Although, the protein supplement \nappeared to provide additional benefits to the RT intervention for gains in lean mass in the upper \nbody, confounding factors may have influenced these results. The training volume of the upper \nbody exercises performed was approaching significance (p=0.07) to be greater in the RT+protein \ngroup and considering the RT+protein group did not significantly increase protein intake over \nthe entire 12-week intervention we cannot conclude that the protein supplement consumed in the \npresent study provided additional benefits to the RT intervention. Perhaps the somewhat higher \nintake of protein allowed the women in this group to recover quicker and perform more \nrepetitions of the exercises, which may have influenced upper body lean mass in the present \nstudy. Further research needs to be completed on evaluating the effects of compliance to \nincreased levels of protein and the amount of protein that should be consumed by this population \nto elicit changes in body composition. Therefore, we must reject our hypothesis that greater \nchanges in body composition, muscular strength, physical function and blood biomarkers would \nbe seen in BCS who consumed a protein supplement combined with resistance training \ncompared to a BCS who only resistance trained. \n\n86 \n \n5.1 Muscular strength, physical activity and function \nThe improvements in muscular strength and physical function in the present study are \ncongruent with other studies that have utilized RT at varying intensities in female BCS (59, 248, \n282). Similar to our findings, studies have reported significant improvements in muscular \nstrength in both breast cancer patients undergoing treatment (59) and BCS (236, 248, 282). In \nbreast cancer patients, Courneya et al. (59) reported significant improvements in upper body \nstrength (8-RM on bench press) and lower body strength (8-RM on leg extension) when \ncompared to patients undergoing normal care after 16 weeks of RT (2-4 sets; 10 repetitions; 80% \nof 1-RM; 2 days per week). The advantage of performing RT while undergoing treatment to \nmaintain muscular strength is of relevance to BCS as Simonavice et al. (247) reported that once \ncompleted treatment, BCS were 17% and 29% weaker in upper and lower body strength \nrespectively, than healthy age-matched postmenopausal women. In a later study Simonavice et \nal. (248) observed that after a 6-month RT intervention performed twice a week for 2 sets of 8-12 \nrepetitions at an intensity of 52-69% of 1-RM, both the upper and lower body strength gained by \nBCS at the end of the intervention was similar to untrained healthy age-matched postmenopausal \nwomen. Interestingly, although measured on the same resistance machines (248), the upper body \n(averages ranging from 80 ± 17 to 91 ± 20kg) and lower body (averages ranging from 87 ± 28 to \n100 ± 21kg) strength of 27 BCS after the 6-month intervention (163) was lower than that \nobserved in the overall values of upper (116 ± 29kg) and lower body (116 ± 31kg) strength after \nthe present 12-week intervention. The differences in the muscular strength improvements \nbetween the present study and that of Simonavice et al. (248) are largely explained by the \ndifferences in the average exercise intensities throughout the study (65-81% vs. 52-69% of 1-RM \nrespectively) and training volume (3 sets vs. 2 sets respectively) utilized. In any case, regardless \n\n87 \n \nof exercise intensity and volume, the aforementioned studies and others (236, 282) demonstrate \nthe ability of RT to help BCS gain the strength lost as a result of cancer treatments and physical \ninactivity, and plausibly exceed that of their healthy age-matched physically inactive \ncounterparts. \nUltimately, the improvements in muscular strength lead to improvements in physical \nfunction as measured objectively using the CS-PFP assessment. The BCS survivors in the \npresent study significantly improved their total physical function score as well as all the \nsubscales of physical function (upper body strength, lower body strength, balance and \ncoordination, and endurance) with the exception of upper body flexibility. In agreement, a \nprevious study from our laboratory reported similar significant improvements at 12 weeks in all \nthe subscales of the CS-PFP except upper body flexibility (163). This may be due to the fact that \nthe intervention did not include any prescribed flexibility training other than the full body \nstretches performed after each RT session. As the RT sessions were only twice a week, the \namount of stretching performed during the intervention fell short of the recommended American \nCollege of Medicine guidelines to see improvements in flexibility (≥ β-3 day per week) (106). To \ndate, our previous study (163) and the present study are the only ones to utilize the CS-PFP to \nobjectively measure physical function in BCS after a RT intervention. In contrast to our findings, \nCheema and Gaul (47) reported a significant improvement in upper body shoulder range of \nmotion of flexion, extension and abduction using a Leighton flexometer in both the ipsilateral \n(surgical) and contralateral shoulders of the side of the body affected with cancer following an 8-\nweek RT intervention. However, the BCS in the study by Cheema and Gaul were part of a BCS \ndragon boat team and thus were likely more physically flexible than the participants in the \npresent study. The two tasks of the CS-PFP that contribute to the assessment of upper body \n\n88 \n \nflexibility include a jacket task and a reach task. During the jacket task, participants are asked to \npick up a jacket, put it on, pull the fronts of the jacket together and remove the jacket as quickly \nas possible without zipping or buttoning the jacket. The score is based on the time it takes to \ncomplete the task, but it is not likely that the arm located on the side of the body affected by \nbreast cancer (involved arm) would affect the outcomes of this task. However, the reach task \nrequires the participants to place a sponge on a shelf, let go and then remove the sponge off the \nshelf in a controlled manner. It is not a timed test, and the participants’ scores are based upon \nhow high they can reach and place the sponge on the shelf with complete control. It is plausible \nthat this task may have been confounded by whether or not the BCS used their involved arm for \nthe testing assessments, and thus may explain the lack of significance observed for this one \nsubscale of physical function. Therefore, future studies may need to control for whether the \nparticipants use their involved arm or uninvolved arm of surgery for all assessments of the reach \ntask in the CS-PFP. Furthermore, although the BCS improved muscular strength, Winters-Stone \net al. (282) did not observe any significant improvements in both subjective (SF-36 Physical \nFunction scale and Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument) and objective (Physical \nPerformance Battery - five repeated chair stands, standing balance, 4 m usual gait walk test) \nphysical function after a 52-week RT and impact (jump) exercise intervention (1-3 sets; 8-12 \nrepetitions; 60-80% of 1-RM; 3 days per week). \nMost importantly, the results of the present study and of a previous study (47) \ndemonstrate the ability of RT to increase physical function in BCS. As the CS-PFP is a series of \ntasks that mimic routine activities of daily living, our findings suggest that moderately vigorous \nRT performed twice a week can counteract the effects of cancer treatments and physical \ninactivity and thus enable BCS to live independently and possible delay the arrival of disability \n\n89 \n \nassociated with aging. As the women in both groups experienced similar improvements in \nmuscular strength and physical function, it appears that increasing protein intake in BCS may not \naugment the effects of RT on strength and physical function. \n \n5.2 Body composition \nThis is one of only two studies that we are aware of to observe a significant training \neffect on total and regional lean body mass. Previous studies (16, 59, 235, 248) have utilized \nvarious intensities and have observed significant differences between the RT experimental group \nand the non-RT control groups but to the best of our knowledge only one other study (235) has \nfound a significant time effect on changes in lean body mass in the groups participating in RT \nand few have observed changes in fat mass. Nevertheless, in those studies that found significant \ndifferences between the RT groups, and non–exercising controls in body composition variables, \nBattaglini et al. (16) found a 4% increase in lean body mass and an 11% decrease in body fat \npercentage compared to a 1% reduction in lean body mass and 4% increase in percent body fat in \nthe control group after a 21-week combined RT (2-3 sets; 40-60% of 1-RM; 2 days per week) \nand aerobic training program. This study utilized the 3-site skinfold method to measure body \ncomposition, which may be a less accurate technique to assess body composition. Similarly, a \none-year resistance and impact (jump) exercise program (1-3 sets; 8-12 repetitions; 60-80% of 1-\nRM; 3 days per week) (284) and a 16-week of combined RT (2-4 sets; 10 repetitions; 80% of 1-\nRM; 2 days per week) and aerobic training intervention did not elicit significant training effects \non body composition in BCS. It appears, the varying intensities (% of 1-RM), training volume \n(sets, repetitions, days per week) and progression utilized in these studies may explain why the \nBCS did not experience significant changes in body composition over time. In contrast, the \n\n90 \n \npresent study observed significant changes over time, with the BCS experiencing average \nchanges of +2% (+0.88 kg) in lean body mass, -2% (-0.51 kg) in body fat, -1% in body fat \npercentage, +5% in the lean to fat mass ratio, and +3% in the ASMI. Similar to our findings, a 6-\nmonth RT intervention (3 sets; 10-12 RM, ~ 67-70% of 1-RM; 2 days per week) by Schmitz et \nal. (235) that used the DXA to assess body composition found lean mass to significantly increase \nfrom baseline in RT by 0.88 ± 0.23 kg as well as a significant reduction in body fat percentage (-\n1.15 ± 0.45 %). It is important to note that these changes occurred after 6 months of RT, whereas \nthe significant improvements in body composition in the present study, although modest, were \nobserved after only 12 weeks of RT performed twice a week. Be that as it may, the training \nvolume and intensity utilized that used a superset design, and most importantly had the women \nperform their 3rd set of each exercise to muscular fatigue, and thereby exceeding the 12 \nrepetitions, often utilized in studies, created a greater volume and intensity than that used in \nprevious studies. Furthermore, this approach allowed us to appropriately increase the amount of \nweight lifted by each participant at the beginning of each week depending on the amount of \nrepetitions above 10 repetitions she was able to perform during her 3rd and final set of each \nexercise. Thus, the protocol utilized in this present study ensured that the moderately vigorous \nexercise intensity was maintained and progressed according to each participant’s weekly strength \nincreases. The RT protocol utilized in the present study performed over a longer duration than 12 \nweeks has the potential to result in even greater changes in body composition over time. \nThis is plausible because a previous 6-month RT intervention from our laboratory (248) \nperformed similar exercises, twice a week as those in the present study, and prescribed a regimen \nof 10 exercises, for 2 sets of 8-12 repetitions at an intensity of 52-69% of the 1-RM therefore the \nparticipants never exceeded 69% of their previous 1-RM (measured every 4 weeks) for both \n\n91 \n \nupper body and lower body strength. The BCS in the present study began their RT at 65% of \neach participant's 1-RM in week one of the intervention and performed 2 sets of 10 repetitions \nand a 3rd set (>10 repetitions) to muscular exhaustion on 10 exercises performed in a superset \ndesign. The present study design provided a training volume sufficient to increase lean body \nmass, but more importantly the women in both groups trained at a similar intensity throughout \nthe study and progressed according to the target exercise intensity. The BCS in the present study \nprogressed to an average of 70 ± 5% of the baseline upper body 1-RM during the first 6 weeks \nand to 76 ± 7% of their 6-week (mid-study) upper body 1-RM by week 12. Their lower body \nexercise intensity progressed from an average 69 ± 5% of baseline 1-RM during the first 6 weeks \nto a more vigorous intensity of 81 ± 9% of their 6-week 1-RM during the last 6 weeks. The RT \nsessions were well tolerated with an adherence rate of 90%. \nAlthough the adherence to the protein supplement was on average 90.7 ± 8.6 %, with the \nexception of changes in the lean mass of the arms, there was no added benefit on changes in \nbody composition from consumption of the daily protein supplement. However, as previously \nstated, the greater improvements in the lean mass of the arms observed in the RT+protein group \nis largely explained by the somewhat greater training volume in upper body exercises performed \nby the women in the RT+protein group. The absence of any group differences in the remaining \nmeasures of body composition is most likely due to the prescribed 40g of added protein not \ncreating an adequate protein change to elicit a group by time effect. It was also found that the \nwomen even though compliant to the supplement changed the amount of protein being consumed \nin their diet at different time points throughout the study. Therefore we cannot be certain that the \nwomen had the increased protein stimulus throughout the entire 12-week intervention. In \naddition, Bosse & Dixon (23) described protein change as the change in habitual protein intake \n\n92 \n \nfrom baseline, and have reported that an average protein change of at least +59.5% is needed to \nobserve group differences in interventions using protein and RT. The protein change for the \nRT+protein group in the present study was only +27.3 ± 34.5% and therefore adding 40 g of \nprotein, consumed in two separate 20 g ready to drink bottles, to the habitual diet of the BCS in \nthis study was not sufficient to demonstrate an additional benefit of protein. Although the \nparticipants in the present were asked to maintain their regular dietary intake throughout the \nstudy duration, the protein change of the participants in the RT+protein group ranged from -2.8% \nto 143.1%. This presents a major limitation of our study because the protein we provided in our \nstudy did not actually supplement the dietary protein consumed by each participant, as those that \nhad a negative or a moderately positive (+1 to 10%) protein change most likely reduced their \ndietary protein intake to compensate for the protein beverage provided during the study. When \nan analysis for group differences was performed in changes in lean mass with only those \nparticipants in the RT+protein group that had a protein change greater than 20% (n=8) a group \nby time effect that was approaching significance was observed (p=0.079) for total lean body \nmass. A greater than 20% protein change in the RT+protein group resulted in greater increase in \ntotal body lean mass that was approaching significance when compared to the RT (+1.47kg vs. \n+0.68kg; p=0.079 ). As only one participant in the RT+protein group had a protein change \ngreater than the recommended +59.5%, future studies should either standardize the diet of their \nparticipants or collect more frequent dietary logs to continuously ensure dietary habits are \nactually being maintained and thus the protein beverage is indeed supplementing the diet of the \nexperimental group. Furthermore, Bosse & Dixon (23) also reported that a protein spread, \ndefined as the difference in protein consumed (g/kg/day) between the experimental and control \ngroups, of at least 66.1% has been observed in those studies that reported group differences \n\n93 \n \nbetween the groups consuming and not consuming protein during an RT intervention. The \nprotein spread observed in the present study was 29.4% and therefore not adequate to produce an \neffect. This is evident as the protein change in the RT group ranged from -69.6% to 96.2%, thus \nsome participants increased their dietary protein therefore this did not create an adequate \ndifference between average intake of the RT+protein (experimental) and RT group (control) even \nthough the difference in protein intake (% of total caloric intake) at 12 weeks was significantly \ndifferent (21.2 ± 4.2 % vs. 17.3 ± 6.5%). It is important to note that the studies reviewed by \nBosse & Dixon to determine the recommendations for protein change and spread were in non-\ncancer related populations and thus the requirements may be different for BCS. Nevertheless, \nfuture RT and protein interventions for BCS do need to create a sufficient protein change and \nspread to further elucidate the potential benefits of increased protein intake to augment the \npositive changes in body composition as a result of RT. Therefore the exercise intensity utilized \nin the present study appears to be the determining factor for the significant increases in lean body \nmass and decreases in fat mass that are not often observed in female BCS. \n \n5.3 Dietary and supplemental nutrient intake and adherence \n With the exception of the lean mass in the arms, the absence of any group differences in \nchanges in the measures of body composition between the RT+protein and RT, were likely \nbecause of the inadequate protein change and spread. Therefore our findings do not support our \nhypothesis that the RT+protein group would demonstrate greater increases in lean body mass and \ngreater decrements in fat mass compared to the BCS participating in RT alone. Participants \ncompleted three-day dietary food logs at baseline, 6 weeks and at 12 weeks. The women in both \ngroups consumed a similar amount of protein from their diet at baseline (RT+protein: 1.00 ± \n\n94 \n \n0.24 g/kg/day vs. RT: 0.99 ± 0.39 g/kg/day) and all the women averaged 1.00 g/kg/day of protein \nor 16% of total calories coming from protein in their diet. Early studies recommend that aging \nadults (56-80 years) need to consume 1.14 g/kg/day of protein (40) and more recently the \nrecommendation has increased to 1.4-1.6 g/kg/day (25, 51). At baseline, of the 32 women that \ncompleted the three-day food logs, 24 of them consumed more than the RDA for protein (0.8 \ng/kg/day) and 8 BCS consumed less than the RDA. In addition, 10 BCS consumed more than the \nrecommended 1.14 g/kg/day of protein for aging adults at baseline. Protein intake at baseline was \nsignificantly correlated with percent body fat (r=-0.502) and lean to fat mass ratio (r=0.487) in \nthe present study. In contrast, a previous study (197) from our laboratory found significant \ncorrelations between protein intake and total body (r=0.502) and total femur (r=0.511) BMD in \n27 BCS but did not find any relationships between protein intake and any other measures of body \ncomposition. The participants in the present study were younger (59±8 yrs) than the BCS in the \nstudy by Page et al. (197) (age: 64±7yrs) even though they consumed an average protein intake \n(1.06±0.54 g/kg/day) similar to that of the BCS in the present study. Nevertheless, both studies \nsuggest that a higher amount of habitual protein in the diet of BCS may modulate body \ncomposition. The present study aimed to determine whether increasing the amount of protein \nthrough supplementation during an RT intervention would be more advantageous than RT alone. \nInitial analyses of baseline to 12-week three-day foods revealed that by the end of the 12 weeks \nthe BCS in the RT+group consumed a significantly greater amount of protein in their diet than \nthe RT group as they increased from 1.00 ± 0.24 g/kg/day (16% of total calories coming from \nprotein) to 1.24 ± 0.30 g/kg/day (21% of total calories coming from protein). The participants in \nthe RT group maintained their protein intake from 0.99 ± 0.39 g/kg/day (16% of total calories \ncoming from protein) at baseline to 0.96 ± 0.41 g/kg/day (17% of total calories coming from \n\n95 \n \nprotein). However, changes in protein intake from baseline to 6 weeks were not significantly \ndifferent between the two groups, neither were changes from baseline to the average of the \ncombined 6-week and 12-week food logs. Therefore, because of the variation in the three-day \nfoods at 6 weeks and 12 weeks we cannot definitively conclude that the RT+protein actually \nconsumed significantly more protein than the RT only group during the entire 12-week \nintervention. \nOn average the 40 g daily protein supplement provided to the BCS in the present study \nwas sufficient to increase the average intake of protein to above that of the earlier \nrecommendations for aging adults of 1.14 g/kg/day of protein (40) if we assume the BCS \naccurately reported their dietary food logs. However as a result of the variation in the amount of \nprotein consumed in the present study we cannot conclude whether adding 40 g of protein to the \nhabitual diet of BCS is beneficial. Thus, the findings of the present study may provide guidance \nto future studies to assign more frequent dietary logs to the participants, as well as analyze the \nfood logs immediately in order to provide instructions to the participants on making dietary \nadjustments in order to remain within the study parameters. Further, in order to achieve a protein \nchange of 59.5% as recommended by Bosse and Dixon (23), the present study would have had to \nprovide a 60 g protein supplement to the RT+protein group instead of the 40 g that was \nprescribed. Be that as it may, this is to the best of our knowledge the first study to include a \nprotein supplement as part of an exercise intervention in BCS and thus provides direction for \nfuture studies. \nIn frail older adults (78 ±1 years) without a previous cancer diagnosis, a 30 g protein \nsupplement (milk protein concentrate) combined with 24 weeks of RT (2 days per week) elicited \na significant 1.3 kg increase in lean mass (267), whereas, 40 g of whey protein in mobility \n\n96 \n \nlimited older adults (70-85 years) performing RT (3 days per week) for 6 months did not find \nsignificant differences compared to the placebo group consuming an isocaloric maltodextrin \nsupplement (45). The discrepancies in these results warrant more studies to investigate the ideal \ndose and type of protein needed to augment the benefits of RT in both healthy older adults and \ncancer survivors. Furthermore, the recommendations are most likely different in the cancer \npopulation as a blunted response in MPS to a 40 g amino acid feeding has been reported in \novarian cancer patients (73) and lower amounts of plasma amino acid were available for MPS in \na heterogeneous group of breast, colon and pancreatic cancer patients (275) compared to healthy \nage and sex matched controls. \nInterestingly, although the BCS in both groups were asked to maintain their regular \ncalcium and vitamin D intake throughout the study, there were significant group by time changes \nin dietary calcium and vitamin D intake. Analysis of three-day food logs found no differences \nbetween the groups in dietary calcium and vitamin D at baseline. However, over the 12 weeks, \nthe women in the RT+protein group increased their average dietary calcium intake by 74% (763 \n± 179 to 1324 ± 413 mg/d) and the vitamin D intake by 161% (179 ± 176 to 468 ± 244 IU/d), \ncompared to a 20% (900 ± 426 to 719 ± 331 mg/d) and a 31% (221 ± 222 to 152 ± 252 IU/d) \ndecrease in dietary calcium and vitamin D intake respectively, observed in the RT group. The \ngroup differences in dietary calcium and vitamin D intake is largely explained by the extra \ncalcium (600 mg) and vitamin D (320 IU) provided by the daily protein supplement that was \nconsumed by the RT+protein group. At baseline, the supplementary calcium and vitamin D was \nsimilar between the groups and the participants were asked to maintain their daily \nsupplementation throughout the 12-week study. However only 26 participants returned \ncompleted calcium and vitamin D logs, and analysis of these logs revealed the 16 women in the \n\n97 \n \nRT+protein group had a significantly greater adherence to consumption of their supplementary \ncalcium and vitamin D than the 10 women in the RT group (94% vs. 84%; p≤0.05). As there \nwere no significant differences between the groups in any of the primary outcome variables, it is \nnot likely that the differences in calcium and vitamin D intake were confounding factors. \nFurthermore, it is not clear what the role of calcium and vitamin D intake plays in muscle and fat \nmetabolism during a RT intervention in BCS. A previous RT intervention (248) controlled for \ncalcium and vitamin D intake by asking the participants in both intervention groups to replace \ntheir daily calcium and vitamin D supplements with those provided by the study (900 mg \ncalcium and 1600 IU vitamin D) and did not find any significant effects of calcium and vitamin \nD intake on body composition. However, at baseline a significant correlation was observed \nbetween dietary calcium intake and lean mass (r=0.444) in the 27 women about to begin the 6-\nmonth RT intervention (197). The average calcium intake from food and supplements from that \nstudy was 1,846±746 mg/day and was slightly lower than that of the present study (2,042±710 \nmg/day) therefore the importance of calcium intake to modulate body composition in BCS is yet \nto be elucidated. Winter-stone et al. (283) observed that on average, a sample of 258 BCS were \nconsuming 40% less calcium than the recommended RDI of 1,200 mg/day and although calcium \nintake decreased slightly in both the intervention and control groups, calcium intake was not a \nconfounding factor during a12-month RT intervention. In the present study, there were no \nsignificant correlations between lean body mass and calcium and vitamin D at baseline and at 12 \nweeks. \n \n \n \n\n98 \n \n5.4 Blood biomarkers \nContrary to our hypothesis, the women in the RT+protein group did not increase serum \nlevels of the anabolic hormone IGF-1, adiponectin, an adipokine nor did they decrease levels of \nCRP to a greater extent than the RT group. However, in agreement with the observed significant \nincreases in lean mass in the BCS in the present study, IGF-1, a marker of muscle metabolism \nincreased significantly from baseline thereby elucidating a potential mechanism for the \nincrement in lean mass in BCS from RT. As a growth factor, IGF-1 plays an important role in the \nregulation of skeletal muscle mass as the two isoforms of IGF-1 produced by skeletal muscle, \nmechano-growth factor (MGF) and IGF-1 up-regulate satellite cell replenishment in response to \nexercise, and up-regulates MPS respectively thus are mediators of muscle repair and hypertrophy \n(201). Normal levels of IGF-1 range from 40-258 ng/mL(18, 115) and decrease with aging and \ntherefore contribute to loss of lean mass in aging adults (167, 231). However, as IGF-1 is a \ngrowth factor, a paradox exists as IGF-1 at levels above normal (40-258 ng/mL) can increase the \ndevelopment of estrogen-mediated breast carcinogenesis (146) via IGF-1’s role in stimulating \nestrogen from adipose tissue. Thus the concern for BCS is the risk of cancer reoccurrence by \nincreasing IGF-1 levels to above normal levels of women over the age of 45 years (100). The \nserum levels of IGF-1 of the BCS in the present study increased from 106.2 ± 36.8 ng/mL at \nbaseline to115.7 ± 34.6 ng/mL by the end of the 12-week RT intervention. Therefore, the BCS \ndid not exceed the normal range (40-258 ng/mL) for serum levels of IGF-1 as the measured \nvalues at 12 weeks ranged from 46.9 ng/mL to 202.5 ng/mL. Similar to our findings, progressive \nRT (6-12 RM, 6 sets per muscle group, 3 days/week) significantly increased IGF-1 levels by \n16.0 ± 7.5% in healthy older overweight and obese adults (53.3 ± 8.7 yrs) but did not exceed \nnormal values (11) and a 6-month RT intervention (2 d/wk) did not significantly increase IGF-1 \n\n99 \n \nabove normal values in 39 BCS (53.3 ± 8.7 yrs; mean age ± SD) with normal levels at baseline \n(235). These findings are encouraging; as it demonstrates RT in BCS is safe and does not \ncontribute to the increase in IGF-1 mediated risk of cancer reoccurrence. More importantly, \nincreasing serum levels of IGF-1 in BCS within the normal range for healthy women potentially \nmediates skeletal MPS and thus increases the lean body mass in BCS regardless of protein \nintake. In addition, at 12 weeks IGF-1 was negatively correlated with total body fat percentage \n(r=-0.404; p≤0.05) thus further elucidating the role of IGF-1 to modulate body composition in \nresponse to RT in BCS. Furthermore, adding 40 g of protein in the present study did not increase \nIGF levels out of the normal range and therefore, supplementing the diet with protein for 12 \nweeks appears to not increase the IGF-1 mediated cancer risk in female BCS. \nHowever, in contrast to our hypothesis and to the decrements in body fat observed in the \npresent study, serum levels of adiponectin did not increase significantly nor were they \nsignificantly different between the groups. Although adiponectin is secreted by adipose tissue, \nsecretion of adiponectin is actually inhibited by elevated body fat levels largely due to obesity \nrelated inflammation (32, 193). Normal values of adiponectin range from 0.865-21.4 mg/L and \nhave been shown to increase after weight loss (121, 165), however, the lack of any significant \nchanges in adiponectin in the present study are likely because with the exception of two \nparticipants who had adiponectin levels above normal at baseline and at 12 weeks, the BCS were \nwell within the normal the range. Thus, we were most likely not able to significantly alter values \nof adiponectin that were already normal at baseline. Additionally, inflammation, as measured by \nCRP, did not decrease during our 12-week RT intervention and therefore may have attenuated \nany significant increases in adiponectin. This is evident, as CRP was negatively correlated with \nadiponectin at baseline (r= -0.412; p≤0.05) and at 12 weeks (r=-0.503; p≤0.05). Furthermore, \n\n100 \n \nhuman CRP levels were significantly greater in the RT+protein group than the RT group at \nbaseline and serum levels of CRP remained significantly higher at 12 weeks. Therefore, the \nincreased protein intake in the present study had no effect on inflammation. Thus, future diet and \nexercise interventions in BCS should aim to include anti-inflammatory foods as a component of \nthe dietary intervention in order to significantly decrease inflammation and accordingly increase \nadiponectin levels. This is important, as adiponectin plays a role in cancer prevention and \ncontrol. Adiponectin inhibits tumor cell development and proliferation via its anti-proliferative \neffects that inhibit angiogenesis and therefore decreases the risk of development and \nreoccurrence (192). Previous RT (96) and aerobic exercise (108, 229) interventions have not \nreported any changes in adiponectin levels in postmenopausal women with no prior cancer \ndiagnosis, largely as a result of an absence of weight loss. However, Abbenhardt et al. (2) \nreported that an 8.5 – 10.8% weight loss after a reduced calorie and moderately vigorous aerobic \nexercise intervention resulted in 6.6 - 9.5% increase in adiponectin levels in healthy, overweight \nand obese postmenopausal women. As the body weight of the BCS in the present study did not \nchange it may be that significant changes in overall body weight are necessary to detect changes \nin adiponectin levels. Similar to our findings, Ligibel et al. (161) did not observe significant \nweight loss and thus did not find any changes in adiponectin levels after a 16-week combined RT \n(lower body exercise; 50 minutes, 2 days per week) and home based aerobic training (90 minutes \nper week) intervention in BCS. Therefore, significantly reducing total body weight and perhaps \ngreater decrements in body fat as well as decreasing the levels of circulating inflammatory \nmarkers such as CRP may be the determining factor in increasing adiponectin secretion in BCS. \nOur 12 weeks of RT intervention did not decrease human CRP levels in BCS possibly \ndue to the absence of significant weight loss. Although total body fat mass decreased by 2% in \n\n101 \n \nboth groups, this was not adequate to produce significant changes in CRP as positive correlations \nexist between CRP levels and body weight (97). However, it is likely that our RT intervention \ndid not significantly decrease CRP because values at baseline were already near optimal. \nAverage values of CRP of apparently healthy adults range from 0.109-4.29 mg/L, however CRP \nlevels greater than 3.0 mg/L are considered on the high end of CRP values (219). With the \nexception of four participants in the RT+protein group, the remaining participants had CRP \nvalues below 3.0 mg/L at baseline, with an average CRP value of 1.72 ± 1.07 mg/L for the 28 \nBCS that had serum analyzed. Among the four women that had serum levels above 3.0 mg/L, \nthree of them reduced their CRP levels below 3.0 mg/L. Therefore, similar to our findings for \nadiponectin, we likely did see and significant changes because values were already optimal at \nbaseline. Similar to our findings, Simonavice et al. (248) did not find significant reductions in \nhuman CRP after a 6-month RT intervention in BCS. To the best of our knowledge, our study \nand that of Simonavice et al. (248) are the only two to measure human CRP after an RT \nintervention. Simonavice et al. (248) did observe a non-statistically significant decrease of 44% \nin CRP (p=0.29), this was likely due to the BCS in that study having high baseline values \nranging from 3.20 ± 4.4 mg/L to 4.13 ± 6.77 mg/L). Although the decrease in human CRP in the \nSimonavice et al. (248) study was not significant it does have important health implications for \nBCS who may have higher CRP values and the importance of RT. Of the studies utilizing \naerobic training as the exercise mode, one observed a decrease in CRP (88) and the other did not \n(136). The study by Fairley el al. (88) that did find CRP to decrease by 1.39 mg/L did not \nobserve an association between changes in CRP and changes in any measures of body \ncomposition in BCS. For this reason, more studies are warranted to determine the most \nappropriate mode of exercise and dietary intervention to reduce CRP levels in BCS. Modulating \n\n102 \n \ninflammation in BCS is necessary as CRP is positively associated with breast cancer \ndevelopment and reoccurrence (246). Nevertheless, the present study did demonstrate that RT \ndid increase the anabolic biomarker IGF-1 but did not exceed normal levels and was therefore \nsafe and is a potential mechanism for the accretion of lean body mass in BCS. Furthermore, the \nRT intervention maintained the values of the biomarkers adiponectin and CRP within the normal \nranges with no detrimental effects from consuming a protein supplement. The safety of our RT \nintervention in relation to concerns associated with breast cancer is further demonstrated by the \nimprovements in lymphedema observed in the present study. \n \n5.5 Lymphedema history and monitoring \nThe finding of the present study and those of previous studies (234, 236, 248, 283) \ndemonstrate that RT is safe and does not exacerbate lymphedema in a heterogenous group of \nBCS (248) and in BCS with or at risk of breast cancer related lymphedema (283). Only one \nparticipant in the present study, complained of swelling in her involved arm at the beginning of \nweek 3 of the RT intervention, however she also reported that she had performed a greater \namount of work around the house than normal over the weekend. Regardless, we determined it \nbest to reduce the intensity of all her upper body exercises from 65% to 50% of her baseline 1-\nRM and proceeded to progress her upper body weights slowly over the following weeks. Apart \nfrom this incidence, she did not report any significant arm swelling or pain for the remainder of \nthe study nor did any other participant throughout the 12-week intervention. Interestingly, even \nthough at baseline the RT group had more participants who did not have their lymph nodes \nremoved compared to the RT+protein group (RT: 44% vs RT+protein: 18%), the women in the \nRT group had significantly greater differences in upper-extremity volume between the involved \n\n103 \n \narms compared to uninvolved arms (RT: 9.52 ± 11.2% vs RT+protein: 1.82 ± 10.2%). However, \nthese differences at baseline did not remain when further analysis was performed with only the \nBCS who had lymph nodes removed. Most importantly, the percent difference in arm \ncircumference decreased in both groups by week 5 of the intervention and remained on average \nbelow 2% difference for the remainder of the study. Therefore, the results of the present study \nadd to the current evidence that RT in BCS does not exacerbate and actually improves \nlymphedema. Furthermore, RT at a moderately vigorous intensity (65-81% of 1-RM) was well \ntolerated and improved muscular strength, body composition and physical function in BCS. \nThe present study did have some limitations. First, our study did not have a true control \ngroup in the form of a protein only group or a non-exercising control group. Therefore, we \ncannot rule out that our findings would not have occurred in BCS who were only on a high \nprotein group or were not performing structured RT. However, of the studies reviewed that did \ninclude a control group, the majority of studies have reported significant differences between the \nexercising intervention groups and the non-exercising control groups in similar variables \nmeasured in the present study. Therefore, we believe the findings of the current study make a \nvaluable contribution to the literature investigating the efficacy of RT to improve strength, body \ncomposition, and physical function in BCS. \nSecond, we did not determine at baseline the required amount of protein to prescribe to \nelicit an appropriate protein change and spread as previously described to identify an effect of \nthe protein supplement. Furthermore, we assigned three-day food logs at baseline, 6 weeks and \n12 weeks, which revealed variation in the self-reporting of the dietary intake of the participants \nin the present study. Future studies should assign dietary food logs more frequently and analyze \nthem immediately to give participants feedback on whether or not they are adhering to the study \n\n104 \n \nparameters. Additionally more objective methods such as asking participants to take photographs \nof their meals and mobile phone applications that allow participants to scan the bar codes on the \nfoods they consume may provide a more accurate representation of dietary habits. As this is to \nthe best of our knowledge the first study to investigate the use of a protein supplement in \ncombination with RT in BCS, we believe this study can provide a rationale for prescribing a \nsignificantly greater amount of protein in future studies that aim to improve body composition in \nboth aging adults and the cancer population. Furthermore, the 40 g per day of protein given in \nthe present study did not increase the levels of IGF-1 to a greater extent than the RT only, and \nneither group had IGF-1 levels increase above normal levels. This finding can provide further \nguidance to future studies aiming to investigate efficacy of a similar or higher dose of protein to \npotential augment the benefits of exercise in interventions for BCS. \n Lastly, the analysis of the blood biomarkers may have produced more significant findings \nin regards to the mechanisms associated with the changes in body composition after a RT \nintervention if we had baseline and 12-week blood samples to analyze for all the 33 BCS who \nenrolled. Unfortunately, three participants were unable to complete the intervention and two had \nunsuccessful 12-week blood draws. Furthermore, one sample from the IGF-1 assay was not \nanalyzed because of a coefficient of variance greater than 20%. Therefore, a larger sample size \nmay have had greater power and revealed the mechanisms associated with the observed \nimprovements in body composition in BCS. \n \n5.6 Concluding remarks \nIn conclusion, this is one of only two studies to demonstrate a significant training effect \nfrom RT on lean body mass in female BCS. The observed improvements in lean body mass \n\n105 \n \ntranslated to significant improvements in muscular strength and objectively measured physical \nfunction in post-menopausal BCS. Although protein supplementation did not have an added \nbenefit, consumption of 40 g per day in the form of a whey and casein blend protein beverage \nwas well tolerated and adhered to and did not cause significant weight gain nor did it increase \nIGF-1 levels above normal. Future studies will need to include a sufficient dose to create an \nadequate protein change and spread in order to detect any significant group differences. \nAdditionally, future investigations will also need to determine the optimal dose to detect an \neffect of protein supplementation but not result in harmful increases in IGF-1. Most importantly, \nfuture studies should monitor dietary intake more frequently and objectively in order to ensure \nparticipants are remaining within study parameters. This may be achieved by assigning weekly \nfood logs and by asking participants to take photographs of their meals. \nA moderately vigorous training intensity and volume of RT was safe and improved \nlymphedema in BCS. Most importantly RT at 65-81% was a sufficient training stimulus to elicit \nsignificant improvements in muscular strength, body composition and physical function. \nFurthermore, the anabolic blood biomarker IGF-1 appears to play a role in modulating accretion \nof lean body mass in BCS, however the efficacy of RT to increase levels of adiponectin and \ndecrease CRP in BCS is yet to be determined. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n106 \n \nAPPENDIX A \nIRB APPROVAL LETTERS \n \n \n \n \n\n107 \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n108 \n \nAPPENDIX B \nTELEPHONE INTERVIEW \nHello, my name is (state your name) calling from The Florida State University regarding the \nbreast cancer research project that you inquired about. We are currently looking for breast \ncancer survivors, ages 40-75 years, having completed chemotherapy treatment. We expect the \nstudy to last approximately 4 months. The 4 months will consist of 2 weeks of initial testing and \n2 weeks of post testing. The intervention period will last 12 weeks. The pre and post testing \nperiods will consist of the following assessments: blood markers for hormone levels and C-\nreactive protein, muscular strength by one-repetition maximal tests, physical function by the \nContinuous Scale Physical Functional Performance test, and quality of life measured by a \nquestionnaire. \n \nThe women in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups for a period of \n12 weeks: 1) resistance exercise training and 2) resistance exercise + protein consumption. All \nthree groups will be given a pedometer to wear for one randomly assigned week each month and \nbe instructed to record the number of steps obtained daily. The resistance exercise will consist of \nmeeting twice a week with an exercise instructor for a guided exercise session lasting \napproximately 45 minutes at The Florida State University. The resistance training and protein \ngroup will be provided with protein and will be instructed to consume the drink in the morning \nand evening or on the days that you exercise after the exercise session instead of the evening \ndrink. Additionally, all participants will be asked to replace their current supplementations with \na multivitamin that we provide containing 600 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D (twice per \nday). \n \nDo you have any questions?
