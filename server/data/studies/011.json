    "introduction": "68 \nAdaptations to exercise training are primarily thought to occur in a mode-specific manner [1]. 69 \nIn this regard, aerobic training is considered to be the primary mode of exercise for improving 70 \nmarkers of cardiorespiratory fitness, such as maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) [2]. 71 \nResistance training, on the other hand, is seen as the principal mode of exercise that elicits 72 \nadaptations such as muscular hypertrophy [3]. However, it is evident from the literature that 73 \nthere is a certain degree of crossover in both the early post-exercise responses and longer-term 74 \nadaptations induced by these two modes of exercise [1, 4]. 75 \n 76 \nAlthough resistance training can increase VO2max (predominately shown in previously 77 \nuntrained individuals) [5], aerobic training is more effective for enhancing cardiorespiratory 78 \nfitness [6-9]. Since the seminal work by DeLorme in the 1940s [10] and as acknowledged in a 79 \nrecent historical review [11], it has been well accepted that resistance training provides a 80 \nsuperior stimulus for skeletal muscle hypertrophy compared with aerobic training. However, 81 \nsome authors have challenged this convention [12]. A recent narrative review by Konopka 82 \nand Harber [12] suggested both modes of training might be equally effective for stimulating 83 \nknee extensor muscular hypertrophy. Following the publication of the review by Konopka and 84 \nHarber [12], these conclusions have been reiterated elsewhere [13, 14]. For instance, 85 \nCeccarelli et al. [13] wrote “Notably, also aerobic exercise has revealed an anabolic potential 86 \ncomparable to resistance exercise by altering protein metabolism and inducing skeletal muscle 87 \nhypertrophy” and cited Konopka and Harber [12] to support these claims. Other authors have 88 \nmade similar claims regarding the hypertrophic potential of aerobic exercise [14]. 89 \n 90 \n\n7 \n \nGiven the increases in protein synthesis with aerobic exercise [15], it is not surprising that 91 \nseveral studies have reported considerable muscle hypertrophy following long-term aerobic 92 \ntraining [16, 17]. Furthermore, some studies comparing resistance and aerobic training have 93 \nobserved that these training modes may produce comparable hypertrophy of the knee extensor 94 \nmusculature [18, 19]. However, this effect has not been corroborated by all studies that 95 \ncompared these two modes of exercise. For example, superior muscle hypertrophy has been 96 \nreported with resistance training compared to aerobic training [20, 21]. Furthermore, in some 97 \ncases, muscle growth has been observed with resistance training, but not aerobic training [6]. 98 \n 99 \nIn addition to assessing hypertrophic adaptations at the whole-muscle level, muscular 100 \nhypertrophy can also be assessed at the myofiber level. Some studies have reported increases 101 \nin type I, but not type II, muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) with aerobic cycling training 102 \n[16, 17]. By contrast, resistance training is primarily considered to induce hypertrophy of type 103 \nII muscle fibers [22]. However, Kraemer et al. [23] demonstrated that resistance training 104 \nincreased both type I and type II fiber CSA, while aerobic running training decreased the CSA 105 \nof both fiber types. Contradictory findings have also been noted in the literature, with one 106 \nstudy showing increased type I fiber CSA with aerobic training, but not resistance training 107 \n(although both modes were equally effective for increasing type IIx muscle fiber CSA) [24]. 108 \n 109 \nIf we only observe the results from individual studies, the conclusions regarding the effects of 110 \naerobic and resistance exercise on skeletal muscle hypertrophy might be that: (a) both modes 111 \nof exercise are equally effective [18, 19]; (b) resistance exercise is superior to aerobic exercise 112 \n[23]; or (c) aerobic exercise is superior to resistance exercise [24]. This clearly demonstrates 113 \nthe inconsistencies in the current body of evidence for the effects of resistance and aerobic 114 \n\n8 \n \ntraining on skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Such evidence is important to inform exercise 115 \nprescription strategies for maximizing skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Given the lack of clarity 116 \non the effects of single-mode resistance training and aerobic training on skeletal muscle 117 \nhypertrophy at both the whole-muscle and myofiber levels, we aimed to systematically review 118 \nand meta-analyze current evidence on the differences in hypertrophic adaptation to aerobic 119 \nand resistance training, and to discuss potential reasons for the disparities noted in the 120 \nliterature. 121 \n 122 \n2 Methods 123 \n2.1 Literature search 124 \nThis review was performed following the PRISMA guidelines [25] with literature searches 125 \nconducted through Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE, and SPORTDiscus. The following syntax 126 \nwas used for the search: (\"resistance training\" OR \"resistance exercise\" OR \"strength training\" 127 \nOR \"strength exercise\" OR \"weight training\" OR \"weight exercise\" OR \"resistive exercise\" 128 \nOR \"resistive training\") AND (\"aerobic training\" OR \"aerobic exercise\" OR \"endurance 129 \ntraining\" OR \"endurance exercise\" OR running OR cycling) AND (hypertrophy OR \"cross-130 \nsectional area\" OR \"muscle size\" OR growth OR \"lean body mass\" OR \"muscle fiber\" OR 131 \nbiopsy OR \"skeletal muscle\" OR \"muscle thickness\"). The search was carried out on March 132 \n28th, 2018. For the purpose of study selection, the search results were downloaded to the 133 \nEndNote software (X8; Clarivate Analytics, New York, USA). The study selection was 134 \nindependently performed by two authors (JG and LM) to prevent selection bias. In the 135 \nsecondary search, the reference lists of all included publications were screened and the studies 136 \nthat cited the included studies were examined through the Scopus database. Furthermore, 137 \nrelevant review papers [12, 26] and books [27] were searched for additional relevant studies. 138 \n\n9 \n \n 139 \n2.2 Inclusion criteria 140 \nStudies meeting the following criteria were included: (1) published in English and in a peer-141 \nreviewed journal; (2) compared single-mode resistance training (an exercise type that requires 142 \nexertion of force against a resistance performed in a dynamic fashion [11]) and single-mode 143 \naerobic training (any form of continuous or interval aerobic training was considered) as long 144 \nas both types of exercise were performed by similar muscle groups; (3) muscular hypertrophy 145 \nwas measured directly at the whole-muscle level (using ultrasound, magnetic resonance 146 \nimaging [MRI], and/or computed tomography [CT]) or at the myofiber level using 147 \nhistological assessments of muscle biopsies; (4) the training program lasted a minimum of 148 \nfour weeks; (5) the participants were apparently healthy adults without any chronic disease or 149 \nmusculoskeletal injury. The studies that employed dietary interventions in which the 150 \nparticipants were in a diet-prescribed caloric deficit during the training program were not 151 \nconsidered for this review. By contrast, the studies with dietary interventions such as protein 152 \nsupplementation for both groups were considered eligible and were included in the review. 153 \n 154 \n2.3 Study coding and data extraction 155 \nThe following data were extracted onto an Excel spreadsheet from the studies that met the 156 \ninclusion criteria: (1) participants' characteristics, including age, height, sex, and training 157 \nstatus (e.g., trained/untrained); (2) exercise prescription details for the resistance training and 158 \naerobic training groups; (3) participants' compliance with the training programs; (4) means 159 \nand standard deviations for pre- and post-training muscle hypertrophy measurements. When 160 \nrequired, the Web Plot Digitizer software (V.3.11. Texas, USA: Ankit Rohatgi, 2017) was 161 \nused for the extraction of data from figures. The coding was performed independently by two 162 \n\n10 \n \nauthors (JG and LM). Coding files were crosschecked between the authors, and any observed 163 \ndifferences were resolved via",
    "discussion": "and agreement. 164 \n 165 \n2.4 Methodological quality 166 \nThe Downs and Black checklist [28] was used for the assessment of the methodological 167 \nquality of the included studies. The standard checklist has 27 items, which refer to: reporting 168 \n(items 1-10); external validity (items 11-13); internal validity (items 14-26); and statistical 169 \npower (item 27). However, given the specificity of included studies (i.e., exercise 170 \ninterventions), we added two items that refer to reporting of compliance (item 28) and 171 \nsupervision of the exercise programs (item 29), as done by others [29-31]. With the adjusted 172 \nchecklist, the maximum score was 29 points. The following classification was used for 173 \nscoring the studies: (1) good methodological quality (>20 points); (2) moderate 174 \nmethodological quality (11-20 points); and (3) poor methodological quality (<11 points) [29-175 \n31]. Two authors (JG and FS), independently performed the quality assessment, and any 176 \nobserved differences were resolved via discussion and agreement. 177 \n 178 \n2.5 Statistical analysis 179 \nStandardized mean differences (Hedge’s g) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 180 \ncalculated based on the following data: (1) pre- and post-intervention mean muscular 181 \nhypertrophy values; (2) pre- and post-intervention standard deviations; (3) correlations 182 \nbetween pre- and post-intervention measurements; and (4) the number of participants in each 183 \ngroup. If the studies presented standard errors (SEs), they were converted to standard 184 \ndeviations using the formula (𝑆𝐸 ∙ √𝑛). None of the included studies presented pre-to-post 185 \ncorrelation values. Therefore, correlations were estimated with the following formula: 𝑟′ =186 \n\n11 \n \n \n𝑠𝑝𝑟𝑒2 +𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡\n2 −𝑠𝐷\n2\n2 ∙ 𝑠𝑝𝑟𝑒 ∙ 𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡\n , where spre is the standard deviation of the pre-intervention score, spost is the 187 \nstandard deviation of the post-intervention score, and sD is the standard deviation of the 188 \nchange score (pre- to post-intervention) calculated as: 𝑠𝐷 = (\n𝑆𝑠𝑝𝑟𝑒2\n𝑛 +\n𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡\n2\n𝑛 )\n1/2\n. This procedure 189 \nfor estimating correlation is explained in detail in the Cochrane Handbook [32]. In total, three 190 \nanalyses were performed: (1) for whole-muscle knee extensor data; (2) for type I fiber CSA; 191 \nand, (3) for type II fiber CSA. A meta-analysis for upper-body musculature and other lower-192 \nbody muscle groups, such as posterior thigh muscles, could not be performed due to the small 193 \nnumber of studies assessing these muscle groups. If the studies presented multiple data points, 194 \nsuch as the assessment of hypertrophy on both legs, or CSA values for different subtypes of 195 \ntype II fibers (i.e., type IIa, type IIx, etc.), the standardized mean differences and variances 196 \nwere calculated separately and the average values were used for the analysis. While we did 197 \nnot include studies in which the participants were in a diet-prescribed caloric deficit, two 198 \nstudies [7, 33] have reported significant weight loss in the group doing aerobic exercise, and 199 \none study reported significant weight loss in the group performing resistance training [20]. To 200 \nexplore the extent to which these studies impacted the pooled findings we conducted two 201 \nsensitivity analyses. One sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding the studies that 202 \nreported significant weight loss in the group doing aerobic exercise, and the second sensitivity 203 \nanalysis excluded the study in which a significant weight loss was observed in the resistance 204 \ntraining group. These analyses were carried out only for whole-muscle knee extensor data 205 \ngiven that the studies reporting significant weight loss did not measure fiber CSA. 206 \n 207 \nThe following effect size scale was used for the classification of magnitudes: small (≤0.2); 208 \nmedium (0.2-0.5); large (0.5-0.8); and very large effects (>0.8) [34]. The I2 statistic was used 209 \nto assess heterogeneity. We considered I2 values of ≤50% to indicate low levels of 210 \n\n12 \n \nheterogeneity; 50-75% moderate levels of heterogeneity; and >75% high levels of 211 \nheterogeneity. SEs were plotted against Hedge’s g to detect funnel plot asymmetry. The 212 \nasymmetry was tested using the trim and fill method [35]. The random-effects model was 213 \nused for all analyses. The statistical significance threshold was set at p < 0.05. All analyses 214 \nwere performed using the Comprehensive Meta-analysis software, version 2 (Biostat Inc., 215 \nEnglewood, NJ, USA). 216 \n 217 \n3. Results 218 \n3.1 Search results 219 \nThe flow diagram of the literature search is presented in Fig. 1. The initial search from the 220 \nthree databases resulted in a total of 2,809 search results. After the removal of duplicates, the 221 \nnumber of search results was reduced to 1,953. Out of the remaining search results, 1896 222 \nstudies were excluded based on title or abstract. Fifty-seven full-text papers were read, and 19 223 \nstudies were found that met the inclusion criteria [7-9, 18-21, 23, 33, 36-45]. Forward citation 224 \ntracking and reference list screening included another 2,859 publications, of which, two were 225 \nincluded [6, 24]. Therefore, the final number of included studies in this review is 21. 226 \n 227 \n***Insert Fig. 1 about here*** 228 \n 229 \n3.2 Study characteristics 230 \nThe pooled number of participants across studies was 509 (median n = 22). The participants’ 231 \ncharacteristics from the included studies can be found in Table 1. The average duration of the 232 \ntraining interventions amounted to 18 weeks (range: 8-36 weeks). The most common training 233 \n\n13 \n \nfrequency was three times per week (range: 2-4). A summary of the training programs and 234 \nstudy details from individual studies can be found in Table 2. In two instances, the whole-235 \nmuscle and fiber CSA values were reported in separate papers, even though they were 236 \ncollected in the same sample of participants [37, 38, 44, 45]. Fourteen studies used whole-237 \nmuscle measures of hypertrophy [6-9, 18-21, 33, 37, 39, 41, 43, 44], while ten studies [6, 23, 238 \n24, 36, 38, 39, 40, 42, 43, 45] used histological assessments (five studies [6, 37-39, 43-45] 239 \nused both). Five studies used CT [7, 9, 33, 43, 44], five studies used MRI [18, 21, 37, 39, 41], 240 \nand four studies used ultrasound [6, 8, 19, 20]. All studies that measured muscle fiber CSA 241 \nused samples from the vastus lateralis muscle and ATPase histochemistry for the 242 \nidentification of muscle fiber types. 243 \n 244 \n***Insert Table 1 about here*** 245 \n***Insert Table 2 about here*** 246 \n 247 \n3.3 Methodological quality 248 \nBased on the assessment of methodological quality, the included studies were classified as 249 \nbeing of either good or moderate quality (Electronic Supplementary Material Table S1). 250 \nSpecifically, five studies [6, 23, 44, 45, 33] were classified as being of good quality, while the 251 \nremaining studies were classified as being of moderate quality [7-9, 18-21, 24, 36-43]. The 252 \nmedian methodological quality score was 19 (range = 15 to 24). Eight studies [6, 18, 21, 24, 253 \n36-39] did not report participants’ compliance with the training programs and, thus, did not 254 \nreceive a point on the item 28. It was unclear in six studies [7, 36-38, 40, 41] whether the 255 \ntraining programs were supervised; therefore, these studies did not receive a point on the item 256 \n\n14 \n \n29 of the checklist. The methodological quality ratings for all studies can be found in 257 \nElectronic Supplementary Material Table S1. 258 \n 259 \n3.4 Meta-analysis results 260 \nThe meta-analyses were conducted only for the differences between the effects of resistance 261 \ntraining and aerobic training on hypertrophy of knee extensors, because no or limited data 262 \nwere available for other muscles groups. 263 \n 264 \n3.4.1 Whole-muscle area 265 \nOf the 14 studies that assessed whole-muscle hypertrophy, ten studies [6, 7, 9, 19, 33, 37, 39, 266 \n41, 43, 44] were included in the final analysis. Four studies were not included due to the lack 267 \nof necessary data (i.e., mean ± standard deviation values) presented in the manuscript, and the 268 \nauthors did not present the data upon a written request [8, 18, 20, 21]. The meta-analysis 269 \nresulted in a significant pooled difference (p < 0.001) in whole-muscle hypertrophy responses 270 \nbetween the aerobic training and resistance training interventions (Fig. 2). The pooled 271 \nHedge’s g, favoring resistance over aerobic training, was 0.66 (95% CI = 0.41, 90; I2 = 0%), 272 \nwhich corresponds to a large effect size. The funnel plot and trim and fill method did not 273 \nsuggest any funnel plot asymmetry. The sensitivity analysis, in which the two studies [7, 33] 274 \nthat reported significant weight loss in the group doing aerobic exercise were excluded, 275 \nresulted with a pooled Hedge’s g, favoring resistance over aerobic training, of 0.49 (95% CI = 276 \n0.19, 0.78; I2 = 0%). The second sensitivity analysis, in which the study by Izquierdo et al. 277 \n[20] that reported significant weight loss in the group doing resistance exercise was excluded, 278 \nresulted with a pooled Hedge’s g, favoring resistance over aerobic training, of 0.66 (95% CI = 279 \n0.39, 0.93; I2 = 0%). 280 \n\n15 \n \n 281 \n***Insert Fig. 2 about here*** 282 \n 283 \n3.4.2 Myofiber area 284 \nTen studies [6, 23, 24, 36, 38-40, 42, 43, 45] were included in the final analysis of type I 285 \nCSA. The meta-analysis for type I fiber CSA data resulted in a significant pooled difference 286 \n(p < 0.001) between the aerobic training and resistance training groups (Fig. 3). The pooled 287 \nHedge’s g, favoring resistance training over aerobic training, was 0.99 (95% CI = 0.44, 1.54; 288 \nI2 = 24%), which corresponds to a very large effect size. 289 \n 290 \n***Insert Fig. 3 about here*** 291 \n 292 \nOne of the ten studies was [40] excluded from the analysis for type II fiber CSA, as it only 293 \nreported results for type I fiber CSA. Therefore, the analysis of type II CSA included nine 294 \nstudies [6, 23, 24, 36, 38, 39, 42, 43, 45]. The meta-analysis of type II fiber CSA data resulted 295 \nin a significant pooled difference (p < 0.001) between the aerobic training and resistance 296 \ntraining groups (Fig. 4). The pooled Hedge’s g, favoring resistance training over aerobic 297 \ntraining, was 1.41 (95% CI = 0.83, 1.98 I2 = 8%), which corresponds to large effect size. The 298 \nfunnel plots and trim and fill method did not suggest any funnel plot asymmetry in either of 299 \nthe analyses for fiber CSA. 300 \n 301 \n***Insert Fig. 4 about here*** 302 \n\n16 \n \n 303 \n4 Discussion 304 \nThe majority of included studies comparing hypertrophic responses to aerobic and resistance 305 \ntraining examined hypertrophy of the knee extensor musculature. Therefore, the results of this 306 \nsystematic review and meta-analysis suggest that single-mode resistance training is more 307 \neffective for inducing knee extensor skeletal muscle hypertrophy compared with single-mode 308 \naerobic exercise. This finding was consistent when analyzing hypertrophic responses both at 309 \nthe whole-muscle and myofiber level. Therefore, the results of this meta-analysis do not 310 \nsupport the assertions by Konopka and Harber [12] that resistance training and aerobic 311 \ntraining undertaken in isolation are equally effective at stimulating knee extensor muscle 312 \nhypertrophy. While some of the studies included in this meta-analysis show that aerobic 313 \ntraining may indeed stimulate lower-body muscle hypertrophy [17-21, 43], our results 314 \nindicate a favoring of resistance over aerobic training. Given the results for knee extensor 315 \nhypertrophy, it seems likely that similar results would be observed for other muscle groups as 316 \nwell. Furthermore, these results are based on analyses with low heterogeneity and on studies 317 \nthat were classified as having moderate or good methodological quality. 318 \n 319 \nDue to the lack of available data for other muscle groups, the meta-analyses were conducted 320 \nonly for the knee extensor muscles. Nevertheless, two out of three studies that assessed other 321 \nlower-body muscle groups, such as posterior thigh musculature (e.g., knee flexors) also 322 \nreported that resistance training resulted in greater hypertrophy of this muscle group as 323 \ncompared to aerobic training [18, 43]. Resistance training allows for the incorporation of 324 \nmultiple exercises involving distinct movement patterns that enable activation of different 325 \nmuscle groups (and regions within the active musculature), which is rarely the case with the 326 \n\n17 \n \ncommon types of aerobic exercise (e.g., running or cycling). It is, therefore, likely that the 327 \neffects of resistance training for inducing muscle hypertrophy as compared to aerobic exercise 328 \nextends to muscle groups other than the knee extensors. 329 \n 330 \nWith aerobic cycling training, a large number of muscular contractions (from 118,000 to 331 \n145,000 contractions per leg) has been suggested as a requirement to impart a sufficient 332 \nstimulus for muscle hypertrophy [12]. Such training sessions usually last from 30 to 45 min. 333 \nIn comparison, with resistance training, protocols involving three sets performed at 80% of 334 \none repetition maximum (1RM) and lasting approximately 5 to 10 min per session have been 335 \nshown to result in a robust growth of the knee extensor musculature [46]. Therefore, 336 \nregardless of the potential for aerobic training to induce some degree of muscle hypertrophy, 337 \nresistance training is likely a more time-efficient mode of exercise for achieving this outcome. 338 \nThis may be important given that the lack of time for exercise is commonly proposed as an 339 \nimportant perceived barrier to exercise participation [47, 48]. 340 \n 341 \nWhile resistance training likely provides a greater (and more time-efficient) stimulus for 342 \ninducing muscle hypertrophy compared with aerobic training modalities, it is possible the 343 \ntime courses of muscular growth induced by these two exercise modes are different. As little 344 \nas two weeks of resistance training has been shown to result in significant hypertrophy of the 345 \nknee extensor muscle group [49]. However, it is possible that the hypertrophy rate is slower in 346 \nresponse to aerobic training [26]. Therefore, Konopka and Harber suggested that to achieve 347 \nsimilar muscular growth, aerobic training frequency should be higher than the resistance 348 \ntraining frequency [12]. These authors suggested that four to five sessions of aerobic training 349 \nper week might be needed to achieve comparable muscle growth to ‘traditional’ resistance 350 \n\n18 \n \nexercise programs [12]. Nineteen out of the 21 studies included in the present meta-analysis 351 \nemployed aerobic training frequencies of two and three times per week. Therefore, it is 352 \npossible that greater increases in muscle size with aerobic training would be observed if the 353 \nincluded studies had employed higher training frequencies. 354 \n 355 \nThe differential effects of aerobic and resistance exercise stimuli for inducing muscle 356 \nhypertrophy might be explained by differences in their capacity to activate post-exercise 357 \nanabolic signaling responses in skeletal muscle. For example, the degree of post-exercise 358 \np70S6K (p70 kDa ribosomal protein subunit kinase 1) phosphorylation in skeletal muscle is 359 \nin some studies highly correlated (r = 0.82-0.99) with muscular hypertrophy consequent to 360 \nlong-term resistance training [50-52]. It has been reported that the phosphorylation of p70S6K 361 \nis increased immediately following both aerobic and resistance exercise [53]. However, when 362 \nassessed four hours after training, the phosphorylation of p70S6K remained increased only 363 \nwith resistance exercise, and similar results were seen for muscle protein synthesis [53]. 364 \nThese acute differences in signaling responses between aerobic and resistance exercise might 365 \nalso reflect potential differences in the time course of muscular growth induced by both 366 \nexercise modes. Future chronic studies might consider exploring this topic further by 367 \nincorporating measurements of muscle hypertrophy at multiple time points during aerobic and 368 \nresistance training interventions. 369 \n 370 \nOne additional matter worthy of discussion when comparing these two modes of exercise is 371 \nmotor unit recruitment. Henneman’s size principle suggests that motor units are recruited in 372 \nan orderly fashion [54]. During exercise, smaller motor units are recruited first and, as force 373 \nproduction requirements increase, larger units are sequentially recruited as well [55]. 374 \n\n19 \n \nTherefore, resistance exercise performed to momentary muscular failure ultimately elicits 375 \nactivation of the entire motor unit pool, which, in turn, should stimulate increases in muscle 376 \nsize. However, during long-lasting submaximal exercise, such as continuous cycling (the most 377 \ncommon form of aerobic exercise across the included studies) the highest threshold motor 378 \nunits are not necessarily activated [55]. Therefore, it is possible that the greater muscular 379 \nhypertrophy observed with resistance training is, at least partially, explained by these 380 \ndifferences in recruitment. 381 \n 382 \nThe meta-analysis results for type I and type II fiber CSA support those seen for whole-383 \nmuscle measures of hypertrophy. Given that the present meta-analysis favored resistance 384 \ntraining for increasing both type I and type II fiber CSA, there appears to be no fiber-type 385 \nspecific hypertrophy response to aerobic versus resistance training. Some of the differences in 386 \nresults between the studies for muscle fiber CSA could be due to the modality of aerobic 387 \ntraining. For instance, Kraemer et al. [23] reported that aerobic training, in the form of 388 \nrunning, induced a decrease in type I and type II fiber CSA. The majority of remaining studies 389 \nincluded in this meta-analysis employed cycling as opposed to running. Cycling may have a 390 \nmore localized stress on the knee extensor musculature than running, and, thus, might have a 391 \nmore pronounced effect on the hypertrophic response of this muscle group. That said, Coggan 392 \nand colleagues measured fiber CSA of the gastrocnemius muscle and reported that 393 \nwalking/running was sufficient for increasing muscle fiber CSA [56], albeit in untrained older 394 \nadults. Running involves concentric actions coupled with eccentric actions and, thus, it may 395 \nresult in higher levels of muscle damage than cycling (likely due to the shock waves 396 \nassociated with the loading pattern of running), which is a concentric-only mode of exercise 397 \n[57]. In that regard, some studies show that, during the initial phases of training, in the 398 \n\n20 \n \npresence of damage, muscle protein synthesis may be directed more towards restoring this 399 \ndamage than to building the contractile protein pool [58]. 400 \n 401 \nThe study by Nelson et al. [24] is the only one that showed an advantage for aerobic training 402 \nover resistance training for type I fiber CSA hypertrophy. However, it needs to be 403 \nacknowledged that in this study there were considerable differences between the groups at 404 \nbaseline. For instance, the group doing resistance training had on average 8% of body fat, 405 \nwhile the aerobic training group had on average 20% of body fat. Furthermore, the group 406 \ndoing resistance training had a relative VO2max of on average 55 mL·kg-1·min-1 while the 407 \naerobic training group had an average value of 44 mL·kg-1·min-1. It might be that these 408 \ndifferences between the groups at baseline influenced the results of the study. 409 \n 410 \nWhile it seems that resistance training is more efficient for inducing hypertrophy of both type 411 \nI and type II muscle fibers compared with aerobic training, given the relatively small number 412 \nof studies undertaken thus far, further work is warranted on this topic. An aspect that makes it 413 \ndifficult to compare aerobic exercise training to resistance training on a single outcome (in 414 \nthis case muscle hypertrophy) is the various characteristics of the training programs (intensity, 415 \nduration, etc.) across the included studies. Many resistance training programs in the included 416 \nstudies were designed to induce hypertrophy. On the contrary, most aerobic training programs 417 \nwere mainly focused on examining VO2max or metabolic changes within the muscle, with 418 \nmuscle growth being a secondary or tertiary measure. Therefore, future studies should 419 \nconsider matching different exercise modalities based on effort and duration as the acute 420 \nphysiological responses (i.e., VO2, blood lactate, energy expenditure, muscle swelling, and 421 \nelectromyography outcomes) may be quite similar between these two modes of exercise [59]. 422 \n\n21 \n \nIt is currently unclear whether matching resistance and aerobic training on the basis of effort 423 \nand duration results in similar long-term adaptations. 424 \n 425 \n4.1 Limitations 426 \nMost of the studies done thus far employed untrained individuals (Table 1) and these 427 \nindividuals are much more likely to positively respond to both aerobic and resistance exercise. 428 \nThe specificity of adaptive responses to aerobic and resistance training becomes more clear 429 \nover time. This has also been shown in terms of protein synthetic responses to exercise, which 430 \nbecome more more-specific (i.e., mitochondrial vs. myofibrillar) after a training period [53]. 431 \nThe study by Kraemer et al. [23] is the only one that included resistance-trained individuals. 432 \nTherefore, while it may be expected that even a greater effect of resistance training (as 433 \ncompared to aerobic) would be seen in trained individuals. However, future studies among 434 \nresistance-trained population are needed. In the present analysis, we pooled different forms of 435 \naerobic exercise such as cycling and walking/running, which may not have the same 436 \nhypertrophic potential, as previously discussed. Additionally, the participants across the 437 \nincluded studies ranged from young to older adults, and the responses to these modes of 438 \nexercise might not be uniform across populations of different ages. Although we did used the 439 \nrandom-effects model to address heterogeneity between the study designs, it remains unclear 440 \nto what extent these factors influenced the pooled findings. 441 \n 442 \n4.2 Methodological quality 443 \nBased on the methodological quality assessment, we can conclude that the results of the 444 \npresent meta-analysis were likely not confounded by poor study designs, as all included 445 \nstudies were deemed to be of moderate or good quality. The study by Nelson and colleagues 446 \n\n22 \n \n[24] had the lowest score on the Downs and Black checklist. However, this study is the 447 \nearliest of all included studies in the present meta-analysis, and older studies often lack detail 448 \nin their methodology sections. The two items added to the checklist (i.e., items 28 and 29) 449 \ncaptured some important limitations in several of the included studies that are specific to 450 \nexercise interventions. Studies that reported training adherence showed similar compliance 451 \nbetween both types of training interventions. That said, it is important to highlight that several 452 \nstudies did not report participant adherence to the training intervention. This is a point of 453 \nconcern, given that any between-group differences in training adherence may have a 454 \npronounced effect on the muscular adaptations associated with each training intervention. 455 \nFuture studies should, therefore, ensure that training adherence is clearly reported for each 456 \ntraining intervention, so that the comparison between training modes remains valid. 457 \nFurthermore, in several of the included studies, it was not clear if the training programs had 458 \nbeen supervised or not. This is an important consideration, as compared to unsupervised 459 \ntraining, supervision has been shown to improve training outcomes such as gains in strength 460 \nand lean body mass [60]. Studies should, therefore, explicitly state whether training programs 461 \nwere performed under supervision, to allow better interpretation of study methods and 462 \nultimately greater practical applicability. 463 \n 464 \n5 Conclusions 465 \nThe results of this systematic review and meta-analysis confirms the common belief that 466 \nresistance training is more effective than aerobic training for promoting skeletal muscle 467 \nhypertrophy and challenge recent suggestions that both forms of exercise are equally 468 \neffective. This finding was consistent with measurements of muscle hypertrophy both at the 469 \nwhole-muscle and myofiber levels. While these results are specific to the knee extensor 470 \nmusculature, it could be hypothesized that similar results would likely be seen for other 471 \n\n23 \n \nmuscle groups as well. Although the identified studies were of moderate-to-good quality, 472 \nfuture research comparing hypertrophic responses to resistance and aerobic training should 473 \ninclude assessments of not only the knee extensors but also other muscle groups. Future 474 \nstudies should also consider incorporating different modalities of aerobic exercise (e.g., 475 \ncycling vs. running) and including trained individuals, which likely show divergent adaptive 476 \nresponses to exercise compared with untrained individuals. 477 \n 478 \n\n24 \n \nCompliance with Ethical Standards 479 \nFunding 480 \nNo external sources of funding were used to assist in the preparation of this article. 481 \nConflict of interest 482 \nJozo Grgic, Luke C.
