Sex differences in resistance training: A systematic review and meta-analysis.J\nStrength Cond Res34(5): 1448–1460, 2020—The purpose of this study wasto determine whether there are different responses\nto resistance training for strength or hypertrophy in young to middle-aged males and females using the same resistance training\nprotocol. The protocol was pre-registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018094276). Meta-analyses were performed using robust\nvariance random effects modeling for multilevel data structures, with adjustments for small samples using package robumeta in\nR. Statistical significance was set atP , 0.05. The analysis of hypertrophy comprised 12 outcomes from 10 studies with no\nsignificant difference between males and females (effect size [ES]5 0.07 6 0.06; P 5 0.31; I\n2 5 0). The analysis of upper-body\nstrength comprised 19 outcomes from 17 studies with a significant effect favoring females (ES5 -0.60 6 0.16; P 5 0.002; I2 5\n72.1). The analysis of lower-body strength comprised 23 outcomes from 23 studies with no significant difference between sexes\n(ES 52 0.21 6 0.16; P 5 0.20; I\n2 5 74.7). We found that males and females adapted to resistance training with similar effect\nsizes for hypertrophy and lower-body strength, but females had a larger effect for relative upper-body strength. Given the\nmoderate effect size favoring females in the upper-body strengthanalysis, it is possible that untrained females display a higher\ncapacity to increase upper-body strength than males. Further research is required to clarify why this difference occurs only in the\nupper body and whether the differences are due to neural, muscular, motor learning, or are an artifact of the short duration of\nstudies included.\nKey Words:resistance exercise, gender differences, strength, hypertrophy",
    "introduction": "It is well-established that both males and females can increase\nmuscle size and strength in response to resistance training (RT)\n(29). Furthermore, several studies have shown RT has multiple\nbenefits for overall health (39,41,58). Although there have not\nbeen any studies that use dose-response models to determine\nwhether males and females respond differently to chronic RT,\nseveral studies have compared the adaptations of males and\nfemales using the same training protocol. However, whether\nthere are sex-specific adaptations to the same training is still\nunclear.\nIn most studies, males increase absolute strength more than\nfemales (10,12,68). Yet, some find that the relative increase in\nmuscle strength and hypertrophy are similar between sexes\n(1,21,28,30,32,36,40,67,70 ,78,85). However others find\nfemales have a greater relative strength increase\n(7,9,29,34,36,38,48,55,56,63,79). In one of the largest\nstudies to date, Hubal et al. (29) found females have higher\nrelative strength increases than males.\nA key consideration in comparing the responses in males and\nfemales is that pre-training levels of muscle size and strength are\ngenerally greater in males, independent of training status\n(3,35,67). Another well-known set of differences between males\nand females are hormonal, which may influence muscle hyper-\ntrophy and strength adaptations. There also may be some\ndifferences in types of occupation that could cause basal strength\ndifferences. However, there is currently no review bringing to-\ngether the major differences between sexes at the neuromuscular,\nmuscular, and hormonal level in the context of RT.\nConsidering the importance of muscle strength and size to\noverall health and exercise performance, it is important to un-\nderstand sex differences in response to RT if they exist. Therefore,\nthe purpose of this study is to determine whether there are dif-\nferent responses to RT for strength or hypertrophy in young to\nmiddle-aged males and females.",

The systematic review was per-\nformed in accordance with the guidelines provided by the\nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-\nAnalyses (PRISMA). A literature review was conducted up until\nApril 2018 usingMedline and SportDiscus. Combinations of the\nfollowing terms were used to produce search",
    "results": "gender or sex\nAND strength training or RT or powerlifting AND strength or\nhypertrophy or 1 repetition maximum. Search terms were added\nusing the NOT term to reduce the number of irrelevant studies\naccording to exclusion criteria (concurrent, children, disease,\nsupplement). Citations from studies were also scanned for addi-\ntional studies (Figure 1).\nSubjects\nA total of 1,162 studies were identified using the aforementioned\nsearch terms, and 24 were additionally identified through other\nsources. Eighty studies were identified as being eligible for the\nreview. After full-text review, 30 were removed for not meeting\nthe inclusion criteria. Ultimately, 50 studies were deemed to have\nsatisfied the inclusion criteria. Of those studies, 10 were analyzed\nfor hypertrophy measures, 17 for upper-body strength, and 23 for\nlower-body strength.\nProcedures\nCoding of Studies. Studies were independently searched and\ncoded by 2 of the authors (G.N. and B.M.R.) for the following\nvariables: descriptive information (age, sex, training status), the\nnumber of subjects per group, training mode, duration of study,\ntraining frequency, repetition range, mode of muscle measure-\nment (magnetic resonance imaging, fiber cross sectional area\n[fCSA], ultrasound, and computed tomography). Results were\ncross-checked between coders, and any discrepancies were re-\nsolved by mutual consensus.\nCalculation of Effect Size.For each hypertrophy and strength\noutcome, a within-group effect size (ES) for each male and female\ngroup was calculated as the pretest-posttest change, divided by\nthe pretest standard deviation (SD) (54). A study level ES was then\ncalculated as the difference between the male group ES and female\ngroup ES. A small sample bias adjustment was applied to each ES\n(54). The sampling variance around each ES was calculated using\nthe sample size in each study (6).\nStatistical Analyses\nMeta-analyses were performed using robust variance random\neffects modeling for multilevel data structures, with adjustments\nfor small samples using package robumeta in R (27,82). The study\nwas used as the clustering variable to account for correlated group\neffects within studies. Observations were weighted by the inverse\nof the sampling variance. Separate analyses were conducted for\nhypertrophy, upper-body strength, and lower-body strength. A\nfail-safe N was performed to calculate the number of null studies\nneeded to achieve ap value of 0.05 or greater using the Rosenthal\napproach.\nFigure 1.PRISMA diagram.\nSex Differences in Training (2020) 34:5\n1452\nCopyright © 2020 National Strength and Conditioning Association.

Effects were\nconsidered significant atP # 0.05. Data are reported as means6\nSEM and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) unless otherwise\nspecified.\nMethodological Quality\nThe quality of studies is important for analysis of systematic\nreviews and meta-analysis. However, due to the nature of\nstudies on sex differences, it is difficult to blind subjects,\ntherapists, assessors, conceal allocation, or randomly\nallocate, which are integral parts of quality assessment.\nBecause this eliminates half of the questions in most scales, we\nfelt it was unworthy to perform these types of quality\nassessments.\nResults\nHypertrophy\nThe analysis of hypertrophy comprised 12 outcomes from 10\nstudies. There was no significant difference between males and\nfemales (ES5 0.07 6 0.06; 95% CI:20.09 to 0.23;P 5 0.31;\nFigure 2). Heterogeneity was low (I2 5 0) (Figure 3).\nFigure 2.Forest plot of studies comparing changes in hypertrophy in males and females.

Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\n\nUpper-Body Strength\nThe analysis of upper-body strength comprised 19 outcomes from\n17 studies. There was a significant effect favoring females (ES5\n20.60 6 0.16; 95% CI:20.93 to20.26; P 5 0.002; Figure 4).\nHeterogeneity was high (I2 5 72.1). Adding training status\n(trained or untrained), single or multijoint strength measurements\n(e.g., leg extension or leg press), training duration (weeks), or\nsessions per week as covariates did not substantially reduce het-\nerogeneity (I\n2 5 69.7) (Figure 5).\nLower-Body Strength\nThe analysis of lower-body strength comprised 23 outcomes from\n23 studies. There was no significant difference between sexes (ES\n52 0.21 6 0.16; 95% CI:20.54 to 0.12;P 5 0.20; Figure 6).\nHeterogeneity was high (I\n2 5 74.7). Adding training status\n(trained or untrained), single or multijoint strength measurements\n(e.g., leg extension or leg press), training duration (weeks), or\nsessions per week as covariates did not substantially reduce het-\nerogeneity (I\n2 5 77.4) (Figure 7).\nSensitivity Analysis\nBecause of the limited sample size, we completed a sensitivity\nanalysis on all 3 outcomes where 1 study at a time was removed to\ndetermine whether that a particular study had any significant\nimpact on the outcomes. However, we did not identify any in-\nfluential studies.\nPublication Bias\nA rank correlation test for funnel plot asymmetry was performed\nfor the upper-body strength results because there was a significant\nfinding (Figure 8). It was not significant (P 5 0.41). We also used\na fail-safe N to calculate the number of null studies needed to\nachieve ap value of 0.05 or greater using the Rosenthal approach.\nThe fail-safe N was 294. Thus, there was no evidence of publi-\ncation bias for the upper-body strength outcomes.",
    "discussion": "This review meta-analyzed studies that compared strength or\ndirect measures of hypertrophy in males and females who used the\nsame RT program. A majority of the studies were completed in\nuntrained individuals. The main finding was that effect sizes in\nhypertrophy and lower-body strength were similar between\nsexes. However, there was a significant effect in favor of females\nfor upper-body strength (ES52 0.60; 95% CI:20.93 to20.26;\nP 5 0.002).\nMuscular strength increases in response to RT are a com-\nbination of neurological and muscular adaptations. Initial,\nr a p i di m p r o v e m e n t si ns t r e n g t hs e e mt or e s u l tp r i m a r i l yf r o m\nneurological adaptation, wher eas subsequent gains are pri-\nmarily the result of muscular adaptations (53). In one of the\nfirst studies comparing untrained males and females, Wilmore\net al., found that strength was similar when normalized to\nbody weight after 10 weeks of intensive RT (90). Interestingly,\nrelative upper-body strength increased 29% in females com-\npared with 17% in males, whereas relative increases in lower-\nbody strength were similar (90).T h e s ed a t aw e r et h ef i r s td a t a\nto indicate there may be differences in strength changes be-\ntween sexes. However, a limitation was that both groups ex-\nperienced considerable decreases in body fat percentage over\nthe course of the study, indicating they were likely not in an\noptimal nutritional environmen t for gaining or maintaining\nmuscle mass or strength (90). More recent data have indicated\nthat both sexes respond to upper-body strength in a similar\nmanner (18). Yet, in the largest study to date with ;342\nfemales and ;243 males, there was a significant difference in\nrelative upper strength chang es in favor of females (29).\nHerein, we cover a number of potential variables that could\nhelp explain the differences in strength we and others have\nfound.\nNeuromuscular adaptations are one factor that could explain\nthe larger increase for females in upper-body strength. However,\none study compared the number of motor units in the biceps\nbrachii and vastus medialis but found no differences between\nsexes (50). The same research group also found no difference in\nFigure 3.Percent change in muscle hypertrophy in males and females.\nSex Differences in Training (2020) 34:5\n1454\nCopyright © 2020 National Strength and Conditioning Association.

Yet, neuromuscular fatigue from RT is\ngenerally greater in males than females, and acute recovery may\nbe slower in males (20). Because the included studies are short in\nnature, this could have an effect on strength adaptations if sub-\njects are not fully recovered during testing. The average untrained\nfemale may also have a lower initial level of fitness compared with\na male (74). This could cause a ceiling effect for motor skills that\nmay explain differences in upper-body strength because the\nstudies were conducted in mostly untrained subjects. Ultimately,\nthere are very few known differences at the neuromuscular level\nbetween sexes that could explain our findings, but more research\nis warranted.\nIt is well established that sex differences exist in skeletal muscle\nmass and distribution (35). Females often have less total and lean\nbody mass, a higher body fat percentage, and a smaller muscle\nfiber cross-sectional area (65,78). One explanation of why dif-\nferences could occur in strength or hypertrophy is muscle phe-\nnotype. Females have a greater proportion of type I fibers (65,75)\nin the vastus lateralis and the biceps brachii (3,50,69). There are\ncurrently no studies that compare the number of muscle fibers\nbetween sexes, but a classic study has shown the muscle fiber\nnumber decreases with age in males, although our data did not\ninclude those over 50 (44). Furthermore, there seem to be similar\nresponses in muscle protein synthesis between sexes (47,76,86),\nand muscle damage due to RT is also similar between, yet the\ninflammatory response may be attenuated in females compared\nwith males (80). However, there are some data to indicate that\nalthough there are similar indirect markers of muscle damage\nafter RT, males could have longer-lasting muscle soreness than\nfemales (11). On a single fiber level, force per CSA and contractile\nvelocity of type I and type II fibers are similar when comparing\nsexes (83). Taken together, there are relatively few differences in\nskeletal muscle between sexes, which helps explain our finding\nthat hypertrophy is similar.\nIt was once postulated that females achieved small increases in\nmuscle size after RT because of low androgen levels whereby\na lesser amount of work-induced muscle hypertrophy would\nprevent them from gaining strength to the same extent as males\n(85). Although it is true that absolute hypertrophy and gains in\nstrength are larger in males after RT, it seems that relative\nincreases in both muscularity and lower-body strength are similar\nbetween the sexes, and relative gains in upper-body strength may\nbe larger in females. Indeed, it is well established that females have\nlower levels of testosterone, free-testosterone, and insulin-like\ngrowth factor-binding protein 1 compared with males (65).\nHeavy training decreases gonadotropin-releasing hormone pul-\nsatility in females (66). Males exhibit lower serum cortisol due to\nchronic RT, whereas females do not (78). Females do not expe-\nrience elevations in postexercise testosterone compared with\nmales (16,86). This differential change in testosterone has led to\nspeculation that females may have an attenuated potential for\nresistance exercise-induced hypertrophy, which we did not find in\nour analysis (72). Another difference is that males have more\nupper-body muscle, which has more androgen receptors (37).\nGentil et al. (18) suggest that this could affect strength gains over\ntime. Another potential confounder is the menstrual cycle. Some\nevidence suggests that females who complete training during the\nfollicular phase can have larger strength gains and more muscle\ngrowth (59, 81, 88) while females may take longer to recover\nduring the luteal phase (46), and most of the studies included did\nnot adjust for menstrual cycle. However, other evidence suggests\nthat the changes in protein kinetics across the menstrual cycle may\nnot play a large role in muscle accrual (51). Although some studies\nsuggest that hormonal differences play a role in changes, larger\nand well-controlled studies are needed to understand why that\noccurs or how it affects strength or hypertrophy adaptations.\nIn a recent review, Hunter presents evidence that sex differ-\nences in muscle fatigue of repeated dynamic contractions are\nspecific to the task requirements (31). Females may have less\nskeletal muscle fatigue compared with males during single-limb\nisometric contractions. It has also been suggested that there are\nindependent responses to fatiguing contractions (31). Likewise,\nshortening velocity is a potential factor to tease out the contri-\nbution of voluntary activation and contractile mechanisms (73).\nThere is also evidence that female tendons have a smaller capacity\nfor adaptation to training (52,87), which may be exacerbated by\noral contraceptive use (26) and could potentially affect strength\nadaptations.\nFigure 5.Percent change in muscle upper-body strength in males and females.\nSex Differences in Training (2020) 34:5\n1456\nCopyright © 2020 National Strength and Conditioning Association.

Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\n\nAlthough a strength of this study is that it is the first meta-\nanalysis completed on sex differences, there are several limi-\ntations. First, most subjects included in the analysis are untrained\nindividuals. It is possible that a longer training duration or other\nfactors could change the results. In addition, the untrained sub-\njects could have different levels of basal activity between studies as\nit is often not well described in exercise science research. The\nstudies included also vary with regard to mode, duration, and\nintensity of exercise utilized. However, our analysis of upper-\nbody strength found no evidence publication bias and no single\nstudies of major influence. It has been argued (1) that many of the\nearlier studies conducted on sex comparisons for both strength\nand muscular hypertrophic changes were hampered by low sta-\ntistical power resulting from small sample sizes (all#20 subjects).\nAnother potential limitation is missing studies due to unused\nsearch terms or databases. There is also a possibility that male\nsubjects could be more familiar with upper-body movements\n(e.g., bench press) that could have resulted in females having\ngreater neuromuscular adaptations. Finally, heterogeneity was\nhigh for the outcomes of studies assessing both upper and lower-\nbody strength, yet incorporating training status, testing modality,\nduration, or sessions did not substantially decrease heterogeneity.\nAlthough there was a mean effect in favor of females for upper-\nbody strength gains and no significant difference between the\nsexes for lower-body strength gains, more research is needed to\nunderstand the sources of this heterogeneity.\nWe found that males and females adapted to RT with similar\neffect sizes for hypertrophy and lower-body strength, but females\nhad a larger effect size for relative upper-body strength. Current\nresearch indicates there are few differences at the skeletal muscle\nlevel between sexes. However, hormonal fluctuations, daily\nphysical activity, and exercise recovery may play a role in our\nfindings. In sum, well-designed studies with a primary goal of\ncomparing male and females are relatively few, and our un-\nderstanding of sex differences in the physiology of RT is in-\ncomplete, which makes studies on sex-differences warranted.\nFigure 7.Percent change in lower-body strength in males and females.\nFigure 8.Funnel plot, using data from studies with upper-body strength outcomes.\nSex Differences in Training (2020) 34:5\n1458\nCopyright © 2020 National Strength and Conditioning Association. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\n\nPractical Applications\nGiven the moderate effect size favoring females in the upper-\nbody strength analysis, it is possible that untrained females\ndisplay a higher capacity to increase upper-body strength than\nmales. Further research is required to clarify why this differ-\nence occurs only in the upper body and whether the differences\nare due to neural, muscular, or motor learning adaptations. In\npractice, it is important to know that both males and females\ncan considerably increase muscle strength and size with RT.\nBecause there are is a paucity of studies comparing multiple\nRT programs between sexes, it is currently difficult to know if\nexercise prescription should be different between sexes.\nReferences\n1.
