The purpose of this paper therefore was to conduct a multi-level meta-regression of ran-\ndomized controlled trials to determine whether protein timing is a viable strategy for enhancing post-exercise mus-\ncular adaptations. The strength analysis comprised 478 subjects and 96 ESs, nested within 41 treatment or control\ngroups and 20 studies. The hypertrophy analysis comprised 525 subjects and 132 ESs, nested with 47 treatment or\ncontrol groups and 23 studies. A simple pooled analysis of protein timing without controlling for covariates showed\na small to moderate effect on muscle hypertrophy with no significant effect found on muscle strength. In the full\nmeta-regression model controlling for all covariates, however, no significant differences were found between treat-\nment and control for strength or hypertrophy. The reduced model was not significantly different from the full\nmodel for either strength or hypertrophy. With respect to hypertrophy, total protein intake was the strongest pre-\ndictor of ES magnitude. These",
    "results": "refute the commonly held belief that the timing of protein intake in and\naround a training session is critical to muscular adaptations and indicate that consuming adequate protein in com-\nbination with resistance exercise is the key factor for maximizing muscle protein accretion.\nBackground\nProtein timing is a popular dietary strategy designed to\noptimize the adaptive response to exercise [1]. The strat-\negy involves consuming protein in and around a training\nsession in an effort to facilitate muscular repair and re-\nmodeling, and thereby enhance post-exercise strength-\nand hypertrophy-related adaptations [2]. It is generally\naccepted that protein should be consumed just before\nand/or immediately following a training session to take\nmaximum advantage of a limited anabolic window [3].\nProponents of the strategy claim that, when properly ex-\necuted, precise intake of protein in the peri-workout\nperiod can augment increases in fat-free mass [4]. Some\nresearchers have even put forth the notion that the\ntiming of food intake may have a greater positive\neffect on body composition than absolute daily nutri-\nent consumption [5].\nA number of studies support the superiority of protein\ntiming for stimulating increases in acute protein synthe-\nsis pursuant to resistance training when compared to\nplacebo [6-9]. Protein is deemed to be the critical nutri-\nent required for optimizing post-exercise protein synthe-\nsis. The essential amino acids, in particular, are believed\nprimarily responsible for enhancing this response, with\nlittle to no contribution seen from provision of non-\nessential amino acids [10,11]. Borsheim et al. [10] found\nthat a 6 g dose of essential amino acids (EAAs) con-\nsumed immediately post-exercise produced an approxi-\nmate twofold increase in net protein balance compared\nto a comparable dose containing an approximately equal\nmixture of essential and non-essential amino acids, indi-\ncating a dose– response relationship up to 6 g EAAs.\nHowever, increasing EAA intake beyond this amount\nhas not been shown to significantly heighten post-\nexercise protein synthesis [2]. There is limited evidence\nthat carbohydrate has an additive effect on enhancing\npost-exercise muscle protein synthesis when combined* Correspondence:brad@workout911.com\n1Department of Health Science, Lehman College, Bronx, NY, USA\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n© 2013 Schoenfeld et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

While some\nstudies have shown that consumption of protein in the\nperi-workout period promotes increases in muscle\nstrength and/or hypertrophy [16-19], others have not\n[20-22]. In a review of literature, Aragon and Schoenfeld\n[23] concluded that there is a lack of evidence to support\na narrow “anabolic window of opportunity ” whereby\nprotein need to be consumed in immediate proximity to\nthe exercise bout to maximize muscular adaptations.\nHowever, these",
    "conclusions": "were at least in part a reflec-\ntion of methodological issues in the current research.\nOne issue in particular is that studies to date have\nemployed small sample sizes. Thus, it is possible that\nnull findings may be attributable to these studies being\nunderpowered, resulting in a type II error. In addition,\nvarious confounders including the amount of EAA sup-\nplementation, matching of protein intake, training status,\nand variations in age and gender between studies make\nit difficult to draw definitive conclusions on the topic.\nThus, by increasing statistical power and controlling for\nconfounding variables, a meta-analysis may help to pro-\nvide clarity as to whether protein timing confers poten-\ntial benefits in post-exercise skeletal muscle adaptations.\nA recent meta-analysis by Cermak et al. [24] found\nthat protein supplementation, when combined with regi-\nmented resistance training, enhances gains in strength\nand muscle mass in both young and elderly adults. How-\never, this analysis did not specifically investigate protein\ntiming per se. Rather, inclusion criteria encompassed all\nresistance training studies in which at least one group\nconsumed a protein supplement or modified higher pro-\ntein diet. The purpose of this paper therefore is to con-\nduct a meta-analysis to determine whether timing\nprotein near the resistance training bout is a viable strat-\negy for enhancing muscular adaptations.\nMethodology\nInclusion criteria\nOnly randomized controlled trials or randomized cross-\nover trials involving protein timing were considered for\ninclusion. Protein timing was defined here as a study\nwhere at least one treatment group consumed a mini-\nmum of 6 g essential amino acids (EAAs)≤ 1 hour pre-\nand/or post-resistance exercise and at least one control\ngroup did not consume protein < 2 hours pre- and/or\npost-resistance exercise. Resistance training protocols\nhad to span at least 6 weeks and directly measure dy-\nnamic muscle strength and/or hypertrophy as a primary\noutcome variable. There were no restrictions for age,\ngender, training status, or matching of protein intake,\nbut these variables were controlled via subgroup analysis\nusing meta-regression.\nSearch strategy\nTo carry out this review, English-language literature\nsearches of the PubMed and Google Scholar databases\nwere conducted for all time periods up to March 2013.\nCombinations of the following keywords were used as\nsearch terms: “nutrient timing”; “protein supplementa-\ntion”; “nutritional supplementation ”; “protein supple-\nment”; “nutritional supplement ”; “resistance exercise ”;\n“resistance training”; “strength training”. Consistent with",
    "methods": "outlined by Greenhalgh and Peacock [25], the\nreference lists of articles retrieved in the search were\nthen screened for any additional articles that had rele-\nvance to the topic. Abstracts from conferences, reviews,\nand unpublished dissertations/theses were excluded\nfrom analysis. A total of 34 studies were identified as po-\ntentially relevant to this review. To reduce the potential\nfor selection bias, each of these studies were independ-\nently perused by two of the investigators (BJS and AAA),\nand a mutual decision was made as to whether or not\nthey met basic inclusion criteria. Study quality was then\nassessed with the PEDro scale, which has been shown to\nbe a valid measure of the methodologic quality of RCTs\n[26] and possesses acceptable inter-rater reliability [27].\nOnly those studies scoring ≥5 on the PEDro scale – a\nvalue considered to be of moderate to high quality [27]-\nwere accepted for analysis. Any inter-reviewer disagree-\nments were settled by consensus and/or consultation\nwith the third investigator. Initial pre-screening revealed\n29 potential studies that investigated nutrient timing\nwith respect to muscular adaptations. Of these studies, 3\ndid not meet criteria for sufficient supplemental protein\nintake [28-30] and in another the timing of consumption\nwas outside the defined post-workout range [31]. Thus,\na total of 25 studies ultimately were deemed suitable for\ninclusion. Two of the studies were subsequently ex-\ncluded because they did not contain sufficient data for\ncalculating an effect size and attempts to obtain this in-\nformation from the authors were unsuccessful [19,32],\nleaving a total 23 studies suitable for analysis. The aver-\nage PEDro score of these studies was 8.7, indicating an\noverall high level of methodological quality.

Coding was cross-checked between coders, and any\ndiscrepancies were resolved by mutual consensus. To as-\nsess potential coder drift, 5 studies were randomly selected\nfor recoding as described byCooper et al. [50]. Per case\nagreement was determined by dividing the number of vari-\nables coded the same by the total number of variables. Ac-\nceptance required a mean agreement of 0.90.\nCalculation of effect size\nFor each 1-RM strength or hypertrophy outcome, an ef-\nfect size (ES) was calculated as the pretest-posttest\nchange, divided by the pretest standard deviation (SD)\n[51]. The sampling variance for each ES was estimated\naccording to Morris and DeShon [51]. Calculation of the\nsampling variance required an estimate of the population\nES, and the pretest-posttest correlation for each individ-\nual ES. The population ES was estimated by calculating\nthe mean ES across all studies and treatment groups\n[51]. The pretest-posttest correlation was calculated\nusing the following formula [51]:\nr ¼ s\n1\n2 þ s2\n2−sD\n2/C0/C1\n= 2 s1s2ðÞ\nwhere s1 and s2 are the SD for the pre- and posttest\nmeans, respectively, and sD is the SD of the difference\nscores. Where s2 was not reported, s1 was used in its\nplace. Where sD was not reported, it was estimated using\nthe following formula [52]:\nsD ¼\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ﬃ\ns12=nðÞ þ s22=nðÞðÞ\np\nStatistical analyses\nMeta-analyses were performed using hierarchical linear\nmixed models, modeling the variation between studies\nas a random effect, the variation between treatment and\ncontrol groups as a random effect nested within studies,\nand group-level predictors as fixed effects [53]. The\nwithin-group variances were assumed known. Observa-\ntions were weighted by the inverse of the sampling vari-\nance [51]. An intercept-only model was created,\nestimating the weighted mean ES across all studies and\ntreatment groups. Second, a basic model was created\nwhich only included the class of the group (treatment or\ncontrol) as a predictor. A full model was then created\nwith the following predictors: the class of the group\n(treatment or control), whether or not the groups were\nprotein matched, training status (experienced or novice),\nblinding (double, single, or none), gender (male, female,\nor mixed), age (young or old), body mass in kg, and the\nduration of the study in weeks. The full model was then\nreduced by removing one predictor at a time, starting\nwith the most insignificant predictor [54]. The final\nmodel represented the reduced model with the lowest\nAkaike’s Information Corrected Criterion (AICC) [55]\nand that was not significantly different (P > 0.05) from\nthe full model when compared using a likelihood ratio\ntest (LRT). Model parameters were estimated by the\nmethod of restricted maximum likelihood (REML) [56];\nTable 1 Summary of studies meeting inclusion criteria(Continued)\nWycherly\net al., [22]\n34\nuntrained,\nolder men &\nwomen w/\ntype 2\ndiabetes\n21 g protein, 0.7 g\nfat, 29.6 g\ncarbohydrate\nconsumed either\nimmediately prior\nto, or at least 2 h\nfollowing exercise\nYes DXA, waist\ncircumference\nProgressive\nresistance training\nconsisting of\nexercises for all\nmajor muscle\ngroups performed\n3 days/wk for 16\nwks\nNot measured Fat mass, fat-free\nmass, and waist cir-\ncumference de-\ncreased with no\nsignificant differ-\nences between\ngroups\nErskine\net al., [48]\n33 untrained\nyoung men\n20 g whey protein\nor placebo\nconsumed\nimmediately before\nand after exercise\nNo MRI 4-6 sets of elbow\nflexion performed\n3 days/wk for\n12 weeks\nNo significant\ndifferences in\nmaximal isometric\nvoluntary force or 1\nRM strength\nbetween groups\nNo significant\ndifferences in\nmuscle CSA\nbetween groups\nWeisgarber\net al., [49]\n17 untrained\nyoung men\nand women\nWhey protein dosed\nat 0.3 g/kg or\nisocaloric CHO\nimmediately before,\nduring, and after\nexercise\nNo DXA and\nultrasound\nProgressive\nresistance training\nconsisting of\nexercises for all\nmajor muscle\ngroups performed\n4 days/wk for 8 wks\n1 RM strength in\nthe chest press\nincreased in both\ngroups without any\nbetween-group\ndifference\nSignificant increases\nin muscle mass\nwere seen without\nany difference\nbetween groups\nSchoenfeld et al.

Because\nthe effect of protein timing might interact with whether\nthe treatment and control groups were matched for total\nprotein intake, an additional model was created that in-\ncluded an interaction term between the treatment/con-\ntrol classification variable and the protein match\nvariable. Also, because the effect of protein timing might\nvary by training experience, a model was created that in-\ncluded an interaction term between the treatment/con-\ntrol classification variable and the training status\nvariable. Adjustment for post hoc multiple comparisons\nwas performed using a simulation-based procedure [58].\nAll analyses were performed using SAS Enterprise Guide\nVersion 4.2 (Cary, NC). Effects were considered signifi-\ncant at P≤ 0.05. Data are reported as means (±SEs) and\n95% CIs.\nResults\nStudy characteristics\nThe strength analysis comprised 478 subjects and 96\nESs, nested within 41 treatment or control groups and\n20 studies.

    "discussion": "This is the first meta-analysis to directly investigate the\neffects of protein timing on strength and hypertrophic\nadaptations following long-term resistance training pro-\ntocols. The study produced several novel findings. A\nsimple pooled analysis of protein timing without con-\ntrolling for covariates showed a significant effect on\nmuscle hypertrophy (ES = 0.24 ± 0.10) with no significant\neffect found on muscle strength. It is generally accepted\nthat an effect size of 0.2 is small, 0.5 is moderate, and\n0.8 and above is a large, indicating that the effect of pro-\ntein timing on gains in lean body mass were small to\nmoderate. However, an expanded regression analysis\nfound that any positive effects associated with protein\ntiming on muscle protein accretion disappeared after\ncontrolling for covariates. Moreover, sub-analysis\nshowed that discrepancies in total protein intake ex-\nplained the majority of hypertrophic differences noted in\ntiming studies. When taken together, these results would\nseem to refute the commonly held belief that the timing\nof protein intake in the immediate pre- and post-\nworkout period is critical to muscular adaptations [3-5].\nPerceived hypertrophic benefits seen in timing studies\nappear to be the result of an increased consumption of\nprotein as opposed to temporal factors. In our reduced\nmodel, the amount of protein consumed was highly and\nsignificantly associated with hypertrophic gains. In fact,\nthe reduced model revealed that total protein intake was\nby far the most important predictor of hypertrophy ES,\nwith a ~0.2 increase in ES noted for every 0.5 g/kg in-\ncrease in protein ingestion. While there is undoubtedly\nan upper threshold to this correlation, these findings\nunderscore the importance of consuming higher\namounts of protein when the goal is to maximize\nexercise-induced increases in muscle mass. Conversely,\ntotal protein intake did not have an impact on strength\noutcomes and ultimately was factored out during the\nmodel reduction process.\nThe Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for pro-\ntein is 0.8 g/kg/day. However, these values are based on\nthe needs of sedentary individuals and are intended to\nrepresent a level of intake necessary to replace losses\nand hence avert deficiency; they do not reflect the re-\nquirements of hard training individuals seeking to in-\ncrease lean mass. Studies do in fact show that those\nparticipating in intensive resistance training programs\nneed significantly more protein to remain in a non-\nnegative nitrogen balance. Position stands from multiple\nscientific bodies estimate these requirements to be ap-\nproximately double that of the RDA [59,60]. Higher\nlevels of protein consumption appear to be particularly\nFigure 3Impact of protein timing on hypertrophy by study, adjusted for total protein intake.\nSchoenfeld et al. Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition2013, 10:53 Page 9 of 13\nhttp://www.jissn.com/content/10/1/53\n\nimportant during the early stages of intense resistance\ntraining. Lemon et al. [61] displayed that novice body-\nbuilders required a protein intake of 1.6-1.7 g/kg/day to\nremain in a non-negative nitrogen balance. The in-\ncreased protein requirements in novice subjects have\nbeen attributed to changes in muscle protein synthetic\nrate and the need to sustain greater lean mass rather\nthan increased fuel utilization [62]. There is some evi-\ndence that protein requirements actually decrease\nslightly to approximately 1.4 g/kg/day in well-trained in-\ndividuals because of a greater efficiency in dietary nitro-\ngen utilization [63], although this hypothesis needs\nfurther study.\nThe average protein intake for controls in the un-\nmatched studies was 1.33 g/kg/day while average intake\nfor treatment was 1.66 g/kg/day. Since a preponderance\nof these studies involved untrained subjects, it seems\nprobable that a majority of any gains in muscle mass\nwould have been due to higher protein consumption by\nthe treatment group. These findings are consistent with\nthose of Cermak et al. [24], who found that protein sup-\nplementation alone produced beneficial adaptations\nwhen combined with resistance training. The study by\nCermak et al. [24] did not evaluate any effects regarding\ntiming of intake, however, so our results directly lend\nsupport to the theory that meeting target protein re-\nquirements is paramount with respect to exercise-\ninduced muscle protein accretion; immediate intake of\ndietary protein pre and/or post-workout would at best\nappear to be a minor consideration. The findings also\nsupport previous recommendations that a protein con-\nsumption of at least 1.6 g/kg/day is necessary to\nmaximize muscle protein accretion in individuals in-\nvolved in resistance training programs [61].\nFor the matched studies, protein intake averaged\n1.91 g/kg/day versus 1.81 g/kg/day for treatment and\ncontrols, respectively. This level of intake for both\ngroups meets or exceeds sugge sted guidelines, allow-\ning for a fair evaluation of temporal effects. Only 3\nstudies that employed matched protein intake met in-\nclusion criteria for this an alysis, however. Interest-\ningly, 2 of the 3 showed no benefits from timing.\nMoreover, another matched study actually found sig-\nnificantly greater increases in strength and lean body\nmass from a time-divided protein dose (i.e. morning\nand evening) compared with the same dose provided\naround the resistance training session [19]. However,\nthis study had to be excluded from our analysis be-\ncause it lacked adequate data to calculate an ES. The\nsum results of the matched -protein studies suggest\nthat timing is superfluous provided adequate protein\nis ingested, although the small number of studies\nlimits the ability to draw firm conclusions on the\nmatter.\nThis meta-analysis had a number of strengths. For\none, the quality of studies evaluated was high, with an\naverage PEDro score of 8.7. Also, the sample was rela-\ntively large (23 trials encompassing 478 subjects for\nstrength outcomes and 525 subjects for hypertrophy\noutcomes), affording good statistical power. In addition,\nstrict inclusion/exclusion criteria were employed to re-\nduce the potential for bias. Combined, these factors pro-\nvide good confidence in the ability draw relevant\ninferences from findings. Another strength was the rigid\nadherence to proper coding practices. Coding was car-\nried out by two of the investigators (BJS and AAA) and\nthen cross-checked between coders. Coder drift was\nthen assessed by random selection of studies to further\nensure consistency of data. Finally and importantly, the\nstudy benefited from the use of meta-regression. This\nafforded the ability to examine the impact of moderator\nvariables on effect size and explain heterogenecity be-\ntween studies [64]. Although initial findings indicated an\nadvantage conferred by protein timing, meta-regression\nrevealed that results were confounded by discrepancies\nin consumption. This ultimately led to the determination\nthat total protein intake rather than temporal factors ex-\nplained any perceived benefits.\nThere are several limitations to this analysis that\nshould be taken into consideration when drawing\nevidence-based conclusions. First, timing of the meals in\nthe control groups varied significantly from study to\nstudy. Some provided protein as soon as 2 hours post\nworkout while others delayed consumption for many\nhours. A recent review by Aragon and Schoenfeld [23]\npostulated that the anabolic window of opportunity may\nbe as long as 4– 6 hours around a training session, de-\npending on the size and composition of the meal. Be-\ncause the timing of intake in controls were all treated\nsimilarly in this meta-analysis, it is difficult to determine\nwhether a clear anabolic window exists for protein con-\nsumption beyond which muscular adaptations suffer.\nSecond, the majority of studies evaluated subjects who\nwere inexperienced with resistance exercise. It is well-\nestablished that highly trained individuals respond differ-\nently to the demands of resistance training compared\nwith those who lack training experience [65]. In part,\nthis is attributed to a “ceiling effect” whereby gains in\nmuscle mass become progressively more difficult as a\ntrainee gets closer to his genetic hypertrophic potential.\nThere also is emerging evidence showing that regimen-\nted resistance exercise attenuates anabolic intracellular\nsignaling in rodents [66] and humans [67], conceivably\ndiminishing the hypertrophic response. Our sub-analysis\nfailed to show an interaction effect between resistance\ntraining status and protein timing for either strength or\nhypertrophy. However, statistical power was low because\nonly 4 studies using trained subjects met inclusion\nSchoenfeld et al. Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition2013, 10:53 Page 10 of 13\nhttp://www.jissn.com/content/10/1/53\n\ncriteria. Future research should therefore focus on deter-\nmining the effects of protein timing on muscular adapta-\ntions in those with at least 1 year or more of regular,\nconsistent resistance training experience.\nThird, in an effort to keep our sample size sufficiently\nlarge, we pooled CSA and FFM data to determine hyper-\ntrophy ES. FFM is frequently used as a proxy for hyper-\ntrophy, as it is generally assumed that the vast majority\nof the gains in fat free mass from resistance training are\nmyocellular in nature. Nevertheless, resistance exercise\nalso is associated with the accretion of non-muscle tissue\nas well (i.e. bone, connective tissue, etc.). To account for\nany potential discrepancies in this regard, we performed\nsub-analyses on CSA and FFM alone and the results\nessentially did not change. For FFM, the difference\nbetween treatment and control was not significant\n(P = 0.27), with a ES difference of−0.08. Protein intake\nagain was highly significant, with an ES impact of ~0.2\nper every 1 g/kg/day. For CSA, the difference between\ntreatment and control was not significant (P = 0.37), with\na ES difference of−0.14. Protein intake was again signifi-\ncant (P = 0.02) with an ES impact of ~0.33 per every\n0.5 g/kg.\nFinally and importantly, there was a paucity of timing\nstudies that attempted to match protein intake. As previ-\nously discussed, our results show that total protein in-\ntake is strongly and positively associated with post-\nexercise gains in muscle hypertrophy. Future studies\nshould seek to control for this variable so that the true\neffects of timing, if any, can be accurately assessed.\nPractical applications\nIn",
    "conclusion": ", current evidence does not appear to sup-\nport the claim that immediate (≤ 1 hour) consumption\nof protein pre- and/or post-workout significantly en-\nhances strength- or hypertrophic-related adaptations to\nresistance exercise. The results of this meta-analysis in-\ndicate that if a peri-workout anabolic window of oppor-\ntunity does in fact exist, the window for protein\nconsumption would appear to be greater than one-hour\nbefore and after a resistance training session. Any posi-\ntive effects noted in timing studies were found to be due\nto an increased protein intake rather than the temporal\naspects of consumption, but a lack of matched studies\nmakes it difficult to draw firm conclusions in this regard.\nThe fact that protein consumption in non-supplemented\nsubjects was below generally recommended intake for\nthose involved in resistance training lends credence to\nthis finding. Since causality cannot be directly drawn\nfrom our analysis, however, we must acknowledge the\npossibility that protein timing was in fact responsible for\nproducing a positive effect and that the associated in-\ncrease in protein intake is merely coincidental. Future\nresearch should seek to control for protein intake so that\nthe true value regarding nutrient timing can be properly\nevaluated. Particular focus should be placed on carrying\nout these studies with well-trained subjects to better de-\ntermine whether resistance training experience plays a\nrole in the response.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors’ contributions\nBJS and AAA performed the literature search, performed quality assessment,\nand coded the studies.
