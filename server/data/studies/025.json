    "abstract": "Recent studies have reported that resistance training in hypoxia (RTH) may augment muscle size and strength development.\nHowever, consensus on the effects of RTH via systematic review and meta-analysis is not yet available. This work aimed to\nsystematically review studies which have investigated using RTH versus normoxic resistance training (NRT) to improve\nmuscular size and strength, and to perform a meta-analysis to determine the effect of RTH on these adaptive parameters.\nSearches were conducted in PubMed, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library from database inception until 17 June\n2017 for original articles assessing the effects of RTH on muscle size and strength versus NRT. The effects on outcomes\nwere expressed as standardized mean differences (SMD). Nine studies (158 participants) reported on the effects of RTH\nversus NRT for muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) (n = 4) or strength (n = 6). RTH significantly increased CSA (SMD =\n0.70, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.05, 1.35;p = .04) and strength (SMD = 1.88; 95% CI = 1.20, 2.56;p < .00001).\nHowever, RTH did not produce significant change in CSA (SMD = 0.24, 95% CI−0.19, 0.68, p = .27) or strength\n(SMD = 0.20; 95% CI =−0.27, 0.78; p = .23) when compared to NRT. Although RTH improved muscle size and\nstrength, this protocol did not provide significant benefit over resistance training in normoxia. Nevertheless, this paper\nidentified marked differences in methodologies for implementing RTH, and future research using standardized protocols\nis therefore warranted.\nKeywords: Environmental physiology, musculoskeletal, performance, strength, training\nHighlights\n. Intermittent hypoxic resistance training (IHRT) is a novel training method that is proposed to improve muscular\ndevelopment and strength gains.\n. This systematic review with meta-analysis reports that while IHRT is effective for increasing muscle size and strength, these\nimprovements are not consistently shown to be greater than resistance training in normoxia.\n. Available studies into IHRT have applied vastly different training programs, levels of hypoxia, and types of participants;\nthese divergent methodologies have likely impacted on the",

    "introduction": "Skeletal muscle is an adaptable tissue that can be\naltered in responses to a given stimulus. Most\nnotably, resistance training has a potent effect on\nthe size and strength of muscle (Kraemer, Fleck, &\nEvans, 1996). Traditionally, acute resistance exercise\nvariables have been manipulated to provide a desired\ntraining stimulus, including the muscle action,\nloading and volume, exercise selection and perform-\nance order, inter-set rest periods, repetition velocity\nand training frequency (Bird, Tarpenning, &\nMarino, 2005). Although certain controversy exists,\n© 2017 European College of Sport Science\nCorrespondence: Domingo Jesús Ramos Campo, Department of Physical Activity and Sport Science, Sport Science Faculty, UCAM Uni-\nversidad Católica San Antonio de Murcia Campus de los Jerónimos, N° 135 Guadalupe, Murcia 30107, España.

In recent years, altering the intra-\nmuscular environment via hypoxia has received\nresearch interest as another method to enhance the\nphysiological experience of resistance training\n(Scott, Slattery, Sculley, & Dascombe,2014). This\nwas originally investigated by restricting blood flow\nto the exercising muscles to elicit localised hypoxia,\nwhich has been repeatedly shown to increase\nmuscle size and strength even when lifting very light\nloads (Scott, Loenneke, Slattery, & Dascombe,\n2015a). However, considering that this strategy can\nonly be applied to limb muscles, researchers have\nalso begun to examine whether performing resistance\nexercise in systemic hypoxia (via breathing hypoxic\nair) can provide similar benefits for whole-body train-\ning sessions (Ho, Kuo, Liu, Dong, & Tung,2014;\nManimmanakorn, Hamlin, Ross, Taylor, & Manim-\nmanakorn, 2013; Nishimura et al.,2010).\nConsidering that one of the fundamental responses\nto exercise in hypoxia is an increased reliance on\nanaerobic metabolism, the benefits of resistance\ntraining in hypoxia (RTH) are thought to be\nmediated largely by increases in metabolic stress\n(Scott, Goods, & Slattery, 2016). Increased meta-\nbolic stress has been reported in several RTH investi-\ngations (Kon et al.,2010; Kon, Ikeda, Homma, &\nSuzuki, 2012; Ramos-Campo et al.,2017a, 2017b;\nScott, Slattery, Sculley, Lockhart, & Dascombe,\n2017), and is likely related to increased motor unit\nrecruitment (Scott et al., 2017), which indicates\nthat a larger portion of the muscle is stimulated to\nadapt during exercise. In addition, large endocrine\nresponses have been observed following RTH (Kon\net al., 2010, 2012; Yan, Lai, Yi, Wang, & Hu,\n2016), although the importance of systemic increases\nin hormone concentrations for muscle hypertrophy\nhas been questioned (Schoenfeld, 2013a; West,\nBurd, Staples, & Phillips,2010).\nConsidering that athletes in most sports under-\ntake resistance training to enhance physical per-\nformance and/or attenua te injury risk while\ncompeting, there has been growing interest in\nRTH from sporting organisations in recent years\n(Inness et al., 2016). Hypoxic training strategies\nsuch as RTH may also have therapeutic benefits\nfor clinical populations who cannot tolerate vigorous\nexercise, such as those suffering from musculoskele-\ntal impairments (Millet, Debevec, Brocherie, Mala-\ntesta, & Girard, 2016). However, despite these\npotential benefits for RTH, there is conjecture\nregarding whether RTH c an actually facilitate\ngreater muscle size and strength than the equivalent\nnormoxic resistance tr aining (NRT) (Ho et al.,\n2014). Therefore, the aim of this work was to sys-\ntematically review the studies which have investi-\ngated using RTH to improve muscular size and\nstrength, and to perform ameta-analysis to deter-\nmine the effect of RTH on these adaptive\nparameters.",
    "methods": "Study design\nThe methodological process was based on the rec-\nommendations indicated by the PRISMA declaration\n(Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, Altman, & Prisma Group,\n2009). The eligibility criteria were established by the\nauthors. For the meta-analysis, only experimental/\nquasi-expe\nrimental research that studied resistance\ntraining under a simulated hypoxic environment\nwas considered. The study was approved by the Uni-\nversity’s Institutional Science Ethics Committee\nData sources and search profile\nA comprehensive literature search was performed\nusing PubMed-Medline, Web of Science and the\nCochrane Library from database inception through\n17 June 2017. The database searches were performed\nindependently by two authors (JARA and DJRC) and\nthe results obtained were the same. The following\ncombination terms was used:“strength training” or\n“resistance training ” or “weight training ”.T h e\nBoolean operator “AND” was used to combine\nthese descriptors with: “hypoxia” or “altitude” or\n“hypoxic training”. The flow diagram of the search\nprocess is shown inFigure 1.\nSelection criteria\nThe specific inclusion criteria were: (1) studies exam-\nining the effect of resistance training under hypoxia\nfor at least 4 weeks on strength performance (via rep-\netition maximum tests) and/or cross-sectional area\n(CSA) and/or and lean mass; (2) the presence of a\ncontrol group (NRT); (3) studies published in\nEnglish and (4) studies provide information of out-\ncomes both at baseline and follow-up. Research\nstudies were excluded if they: (1) used a sample\npopulation with pathologies or not between 18 and\n65 years of age; (2) were not an original investigation\npublished in full; (3) did not specify the tests to be\nevaluated; (4) applied hypoxia via natural altitude\ntraining camps (i.e. not during resistance training\nalone) or other local hypoxia techniques such as\nblood flow restriction (5) did not provide or specify\n2 D.

Two authors (JARA and DJRC) inde-\npendently extracted data from the included studies.\nThe following information was extracted: authors\nof the paper, number of participants included in\neach group, inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO\n2),\nand the training status (untrained: subjects was not\ninvolved in regular resistance training program for\nat least 6 months before the study) (Ho et al.,\n2014); trained: participants achieved at least 12\nmonths continuous resistance training history\nimmediately prior to the study (Inness et al.,\n2016), age, weight and relative fat mass of partici-\npants. Regarding the characteristics of the resistance\ntraining programs, the information extracted\nincluded: the type of exercise, relative load lifted,\ntraining frequency (sessions/week), sets and\nFigure 1. Search process flow diagram.\nThe efficacy of resistance training in hypoxia3\nDownloaded by [Southern Cross University] at 14:22 18 October 2017 \n\n\nrepetitions performed, duration of training (weeks),\ntotal number of sessions, and the outcomes\nmeasured (e.g. strength performance, CSA and/or\nlean mass). When the article presented the results\nby figures, two authors (JARA and DJRC) deter-\nmined the values of the outcome using a digitizer\nsoftware. When there was a greater disagreement\nof 3%, a third experienced investigator (PEA) also\ndigitized the data, and the mean of the two closest\nassessments was used for further analysis.\nEvaluation of the methodology of the studies selected\nThe methodological quality of the selected studies\nwas assessed with the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool\n(Higgins et al.,2011) that is comprised of the follow-\ning parameters: (1) random sequence generation\n(selection bias); (2) allocation concealment (selection\nbias); (3) blinding of participants and personnel (per-\nformance bias); (4) blinding of outcome assessment\n(detection bias); (5) incomplete outcome data (attri-\ntion bias); (6) selective reporting (reporting bias) and\n(7) other bias. For each study, each item was\ndescribed as having either a low risk of bias, an\nunclear risk of bias or a high risk of bias. Risk of\nbias was assessed independently by two authors\n(JARA and DJRC) using the Cochrane risk-of-bias\ntool (Higgins et al.,2011).\nData synthesis and statistical analysis\nThe meta-analysis and the statistical analysis were\nconducted using the Review Manager software\n(RevMan 5.2; Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford,\nUK). A random effects meta-analysis was conducted\nto determine summary effect of resistance training\nunder hypoxia on strength performance, CSA and\ntotal lean mass. The effects of training on these out-\ncomes between hypoxic and control groups were\nexpressed as standard mean differences (SMD) and\ntheir 95% confidence intervals (CI). Differences\nwithin groups were calculated as SMD between the\nfollow-up and baseline times, and threshold values\nfor SMD were >0.2 (small), >0.6 (moderate), >1.2\n(large) and >2.0 (very large) (Hopkins, Marshall,\nBatterham, & Hanin, 2009). The heterogeneity\nbetween the studies was evaluated through theI\n2 stat-\nistic, and between-study variance using the tau-\nsquare (Tau\n2) (Higgins, Thompson, Deeks, &\nAltman, 2003). TheI2 values of 30–60% represented\na moderate level of heterogeneity. A p value < .1\nsuggests the presence of substantial statistical hetero-\ngeneity. The publication bias was evaluated through\nan asymmetry test as estimated from a funnel plot.\nA p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be stat-\nistically significant.\nResults\nStudy selection\nAfter the evaluation of 663 abstracts from primary\nsources, 640 were excluded; 23 were assessed as full\ntexts. From these, 14 studies were excluded\n(Figure 1). Thus, nine studies (n = 83 for CSA;n =\n60 for lean mass andn = 143 for strength perform-\nance) were included (Chycki et al.,2016; Friedmann\net al.,2003; Ho et al.,2014; Inness et al.,2016;K o n\net al., 2014; Kurobe et al.,2015; Manimmanakorn\net al., 2013; Nishimura et al., 2010; Yan et al.,\n2016). One study (Yan et al.,2016) reported two\ndifferent levels of hypoxia compared to the same\ncontrol group in normoxia. All studies were published\nbetween 2003 and 2016 and had sample sizes in the\nrange of 12 –20 participants. Four analysed the\neffects of RTH on CSA (Friedmann et al.,2003;\nKon et al.,2014; Manimmanakorn et al.,2013; Nishi-\nmura et al.,2010), three investigated the effects on\nlean mass (Chycki et al.,2016; Kon et al.,2014; Yan\net al., 2016) and six studies analysed the effects of\nRTH on strength performance (Ho et al., 2014;\nInness et al.,2016; Kon et al.,2014; Kurobe et al.,\n2015; Nishimura et al.,2010; Yan et al.,2016).\nParticipants were mostly trained subjects with mean\nage (SD) ranging from 21.2 (1.9) to 28.4 (1.6)\n(Table I). Fat mass ranged from 11.1 (6.5)% (Ho\net al., 2014) to 17.3 (1.8)% (Kon et al., 2014),\nalthough some studies did not report fat mass\n(Table I). Exercise program duration ranged from 4\nto\n8 weeks with a frequency of 2–3 sessions per\nweek. Two studies used low-load RTH and NYH (6\nsets of more than 25 repetitions at 20– 30% of\n1-RM) (Friedmann et al., 2003; Manimmanakorn\net al.,2013), and one study implemented high-load\nresistance training (two to four sets of three to six rep-\netitions with ≥75% of 1-RM) (Inness et al.,2016).\nThe remainder of the studies investigated moderate-\nload resistance training, similar to that typically pre-\nscribed to facilitate muscle hypertrophy (3–5 sets of\n10 repetitions at 70% of 1-RM) (Chycki et al.,2016;\nHo et al., 2014; Kon et al., 2014; Kurobe et al.,\n2015; Nishimura et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2016).\nSeven studies used lower limb exercise (Chycki\net al.,2016; Friedmann et al.,2003; Ho et al.,2014;\nInness et al.,2016; Kon et al.,2014; Manimmanakorn\net al.,2013; Yan et al.,2016), while others used multi-\njoint upper body exercises such as bench press\n(Chycki et al., 2016; Kon et al.,2014), or single-\njoint arm flexion and extension exercise (Kurobe\net al.,2015; Nishimura et al.,2010)( Table I).\n4 D.

    "discussion": "This paper aimed to systematically review studies\nwhich have examined RTH as a means of enhancing\nmuscular hypertrophy and strength responses. The\nmajor findings indicate for the first time via meta-\nanalysis that RTH does significantly improve muscu-\nlar size and strength performance; however, these\nadaptations are not significantly greater than those\nobserved after the same training in normoxia.\nAlthough these findings do not appear to support\nthe use of RTH over NRT, this paper also highlights\nnotable differences in the methodologies used\nbetween studies which may impact on the potential\nefficacy of RTH, and have led to inconsistent\nresults between investigations.\nChanges in muscle size\nAlthough the interplay of mechanisms which facilitate\nmuscular development are still being elucidated,\nresistance exercises protocols which maximize\nmuscle fibre recruitment, time-under-tension and\nmetabolic stress appear to benefit intramuscular ana-\nbolic signalling (Gonzalez et al.,2016), and therefore,\nmuscle growth. Similarly, the mechanisms by which\nRTH may improve strength performance and\nincrease muscular size likely include increased meta-\nbolic stress (Feriche, García-Ramos, Morales-\nArtacho, & Padial,2017; Scott et al.,2016), and a\nresultant hypoxia-mediated increases in motor unit\nrecruitment (Scott et al., 2017). Cellular swelling,\nresulting from metabolite accumulation in the cells,\nmay also increase protein synthesis and decrease\nprotein degradation, which would result in net\nprotein accretion and muscle hypertrophy (Loen-\nneke, Wilson, & Wilson, 2010). Nevertheless,\ndespite these potential hypoxia-related mechanisms,\nour meta-analysis showed no statistically significant\ndifferences in hypertrophy adaptations following\nRTH versus NRT.\nIn the current study, a significant and large effect\nwas observed for increases in muscle CSA after\nperiods of RTH. However, when comparing muscu-\nlar development between RTH and the equivalent\nNRT, there was a small and nonsignificant effect\n(SMD = 0.24, 95% CI−0.19, 0.68). In addition,\nthere was no significant effect for changes in lean\nbody mass between pre- and post-training time\npoints for RTH, and no difference in lean body\nmass between hypoxic and normoxic training were\nfound (SMD =−0.05, 95% CI–0.56, 0.46). Never-\ntheless, two separate studies have reported signifi-\ncantly larger increases in CSA following RTH when\ncompared to the NRT group (Manimmanakorn\net al., 2013; Nishimura et al.,2010), while another\nstudy observed significantly increased lean mass\ndue to RTH when compared to NRT (Chycki\net al., 2016). In addition, Kurobe et al. ( 2015)\nreported that increases in muscle thickness of the\nelbow extensors were significantly larger following\nRTH compared with NRT (note: this paper was\nexcluded from our muscle size analyses as hypertro-\nphy was not measured via CSA or lean mass). Con-\nsidering these findings, it appears that RTH may\nprovide a small added benefit for muscular develop-\nment over the same training performed in normoxia\n(as evidenced by a small SMD in favour of RTH\nfor CSA); however, the collective findings from this\nmeta-analysis did not observe this effect to be signifi-\ncant. It is important to recognize that the disparate\nfindings between studies published in this area are\nvery likely due to alterations in the structure of the\nexercise performed and how manipulating the train-\ning structure may be affected by hypoxia.\nTo illustrate, research into RTH has employed\nvarying inter-set rest intervals which range from 30\n(Manimmanakorn et al., 2013) to 180 seconds\n(Inness et al., 2016). Although hypoxia increases\nreliance on anaerobic metabolism during resistance\nexercise and can therefore increase markers of meta-\nbolic stress (Kon et al.,2010, 2012; Ramos-Campo\net al., 2017a, 2017b), longer inter-set recovery\nperiods may increase the clearance of metabolic pro-\nducts from the muscles prior to the next set (Scott,\nSlattery, & Dascombe,2015b). In addition, hypoxia\nhas been demonstrated to slow, but not stop, phos-\nphocreatine resynthesis rates following muscular con-\ntractions\n(Haseler, Hogan, & Richardson,1999). It\ntherefore stands to reason that if exercise is structured\nwith longer than necessary inter-set recovery periods,\nthe degree of metabolic stress in the muscles will not\naccumulate as it would if shorter rest periods are\nused, because more time is available for removal of\nmetabolic by products and for resynthesis of phos-\nphocreatine stores. Considering these factors along\nwith the importance of metabolic stress for muscle\nhypertrophy (Gonzalez et al.,2016), it is likely that\nfor RTH to have benefits for hypertrophy over\nNRT, relatively brief inter-set rest periods are necess-\nary to take advantage of the hypoxic stimulus (Scott\net al.,2015b).\nIt is clear that RTH place more reliance on anaero-\nbic energy production, via an increment of blood\nlactate, alterations in acid –base balance (Ramos-\nCampo et al., 2017a), and excess post-exercise\noxygen consumption (Ramos-Campo et al.,2017b).\nRamos-Campo et al. (2017a) observed significant\nincreases in blood lactate and decreases in pH\nduring RTH under high levels of hypoxia (13%\nFiO\n2) versus the same protocol under normoxia.\nHowever, similar to the research from Kon et al.\n8 D. J. Ramos-Campo et al.\nDownloaded by [Southern Cross University] at 14:22 18 October 2017 \n\n\n(2010), Ramos-Campo et al. (2017a) did not find sig-\nnificant differences in blood lactate or pH values\nbetween NRT and the RTH protocol performed in\nmoderate hypoxia (16% FiO2). These results indicate\nthat the level of hypoxia may impact on metabolic\nstress via a dose–response relationship that has not\nyet been established for RTH. Interestingly, a\nrecent review from Gonzalez et al. (2016) suggested\nthat exercise-induced metabolic stress may also play\na role in acute activation of mTORC1 signalling. As\nmentioned before, metabolic stress results from exer-\ncise that primarily relies on anaerobic glycolysis as its\nmajor energy provider. Lactate directly affects muscle\ncells in vitro by increasing satellite cell activity as well\nas mTOR and p70S6k phosphorylation (Oishi et al.,\n2015), and these biochemical signalling responses are\ntherefore likely to be primary mediators if any benefits\nare to be gained from RTH.\nChanges in muscle strength\nConsidering alterations in muscle strength, a large\neffect was observed for improved RM test perform-\nance between pre- and post-training values after\nRTH. However, our results indicate that hypoxic\ntraining was not significantly more effective than the\nsame training under normoxia, and only a small\neffect was observed between RTH compared with\nNRT for muscle strength (SMD = 0.20; 95% CI =\n−0.27, 0.78). As previously discussed, these findings\nmay be related to inconsistencies in the exercise\nstructure used between studies. This is because the\npotential for improved strength following RTH is\nthought to be largely mediated through hypertrophic\nadaptations (Scott et al.,2014), and to our knowl-\nedge, hypoxia-mediated neural adaptations have not\nyet been discovered. Interestingly though, one study\nhas employed high-load training with long inter-set\nrest periods (180 seconds) for strength-trained sub-\njects, and observed significantly enhanced strength\nthe RTH group despite no significant changes in\nlean mass (Inness et al., 2016). However, the\nauthors stated that the mechanisms underpinning\nimproved strength, but not hypertrophy, in their\nstudy are difficult to reconcile as it is not known\nhow hypoxia could augment neural adaptations to\nresistance training.\nAs it cannot be justified solely from the findings of\nInness et al. (2016) that RTH produces greater\nneural adaptations than NRT, these adaptations to\nRTH may be approached from another perspective.\nFor instance, the Inness et al. (2016) study is the\nonly one carried out with highly resistance-trained\nmen. It is known that training status can affect adap-\ntations to power training in high-level athletes,\npossibly due to a plateau in strength and different\nneuromuscular strategies being employed (Baker,\n2001) Therefore, based on the findings from Inness\net al. (2016), it is possible that RTH may provide\nbenefit for enhancing strength in already resistance-\ntrained participants when a plateau in strength is\nreached. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms by\nwhich this could occur have not been elucidated,\nand further evidence to this point is needed.\nAs highlighted previously, a potential limitation of\nthis meta-analysis is the different training programs\napplied in the included studies. Although the hetero-\ngeneity of the outcomes studied was low, these\nvarying approaches to RTH may have modified the\nmuscular development and strength adaptations\nobserved. To illustrate, the duration of RTH programs\nranged between 4 and 8 weeks, and included training\nfrequencies of two to three sessions per week (total ses-\nsions = 10–24). Furthermore, the training sessions dif-\nfered in the manipulation of acute exercise variables;\nthese included exercise protocols comprised of\nbetween 2 and 6 sets of 3–36 repetitions at 20->75%\nof 1-RM, and using different types of exercise (i.e.\nlower limb versus upper limb, multi-joint versus\nsingle-joint). In addition, the inter-set rest periods\nused ranged from 30 to 180 seconds, which would\nlikely alter the metabolic stress and potential adaptive\nresponses associated with RTH, as discussed pre-\nviously (Scott et al.,2015b).\nIn addition, factors aside from acute exercise vari-\nables differed considerably between the studies\nincluded in this paper. The actual FiO\n2 implemented\nin hypoxic conditions ranged from 13% to 16%, and\nit is possible that the level of hypoxia may impact on\nthe magnitude of adaptations to RTH following a\ndose–response relationship (though this is yet to be\ninvestigated). In addition, the training status of par-\nticipants used in these studies included untrained,\nrecreationally trained and well-trained individuals.\nWith increased metabolic stress being a likely driver\nfor hypoxia-related hypertrophy, it is possible that\nwell-trained individuals and athletes with already\nenhanced abilities to complete anaerobic exercise\n(e.g. improved buffering capacity) may not receive\nan equivalent physiological stimulus during RTH\ncompared to an untrained individual. Finally, apart\nfrom the study by Manimmanakorn et al. (2013), a\npaucity of research has investigated the effects of\nRTH on women. Previous research using blood\nflow restriction to facilitate increased metabolite\naccumulation during knee extension exercise has\nshown that females have a greater muscular endur-\nance capacity compared with males, possibly due to\ndifferences in muscle fibre type composition, glyco-\ngen usage or adenosine triphosphate breakdown\n(Labarbera, Murphy, Laroche, & Cook,2013). It is\nThe efficacy of resistance training in hypoxia9\nDownloaded by [Southern Cross University] at 14:22 18 October 2017 \n\n\ntherefore possible that adaptations to RTH may be\ndifferent between males and females.\nAlthough divergent methodologies have been\nemployed and disparate findings published between\nthe investigations included in this paper, some clear\ntrends have emerged. Importantly, RTH was found\nto cause significant increases in muscle CSA and\nstrength. While the results from this meta-analysis\nsuggest that RTH does not augment these responses\nover those observed following NRT, the addition of\nhypoxia may still have additional benefits. For\nexample, Kon et al. (2014) reported that plasma vas-\ncular endothelial growth factor and capillary-to-fiber\nratio were significantly higher following 8 weeks of\nRTH compared with NRT, and these responses\nwere accompanied by an increase in muscular endur-\nance. These results follow the data obtained by Vogt\net al. (2001) showing that high intensity training\nunder hypoxia increases vascular endothelial growth\nfactor and evokes an adaptation in HIF-1 pathway.\nTherefore, exercise in hypoxia appears to result in a\nlarge range of functional adaptations in skeletal\nmuscle (Lundby, Calbet, & Robach,2009).\nIt is important for those seeking to implement\nRTH that they also consider the impacts of hypoxia\non exercise performance. Data indicate that breath-\ning hypoxic air during traditionally structured high-\nload resistance exercise (5 × 5 repetitions with 80%\n1-RM and 180 seconds inter-set rest) does not\ncause declines in performance during training\n(Scott, Slattery, Sculley, Hodson, & Dascombe,\n2015c), while performing high-load RTH using a\ncircuit-based format (3 × 3 exercises at 6-RM with\n35 seconds rest between exercises and 180 seconds\nrest between circuits) does result in decreased\nbench press (Ramos-Campo et al.,2017a) and half-\nsquat (Ramos-Campo et al., 2017b) performance.\nThese divergent findings are likely related to the\nstructure of exercise and resultant metabolic stress,\nas Scott et al. (2015c) did not observe hypoxia to\naugment blood pH or lactate values, while Ramos-\nCampo et al. (2017a, 2017b) observed hypoxia to\naugment blood markers of metabolic stress (pH and\nlactate), and heightened post-exercise energy cost\nand oxygen consumption.\nPractical implications\nAlthough research investigating RTH is in its infancy,\nthis study has provided an opportunity to make rec-\nommendations for both practitioners and researchers\nin this field. While no significant benefits were\nobserved for RTH compared with NRT, small\neffects were evident in favour of larger increases in\nmuscle CSA and strength following RTN. This\nsuggests that some individuals may benefit more\nfrom RTH compared with normoxia, which would\nbe important in well-trained athletic cohorts where\nsmall changes in physical attributes are difficult to\nachieve, and may therefore be meaningful (Inness\net al.,2016). Further research is required to investigate\nthese responses in more detail, but it appears that the\nefficacy of RTH strategies have been impacted by large\nvariations in the structure of exercise performed and\nthe level of hypoxia implemented. Exercise should be\ndesigned to elicit increases in metabolic stress under\nhypoxia, which may be achieved by using relatively\nbrief inter-set rest periods and sufficient repetition\nvolume (Scott et al.,2015b). Considering the findings\nfrom studies which have demonstrated benefits for\nRTH, inter-set rest periods should be very brief for\nlow-load exercise (∼30% 1-RM; ∼30 seconds) and\nbrief for moderate-load exercise (∼70% 1-RM; ∼60\nseconds). RTH should be undertaken in moderate-\nlevel hypoxia (FiO\n2 =1 3–16%), though it is not\nknown whether a dose–response relationship exists\nfor the level of hypoxia on muscular development.\nFinally, it is possible that RTH may impair perform-\nance during training (Ramos-Campo et al.,2017a,\n2017b), though this has not been consistently demon-\nstrated (Scott et al.,2015c). Taken together, these pre-\nliminary findings indicate that RTH may be more\nsuitable for individuals who are training for muscular\nhypertrophy, whereby the aim is to elicit a substantial\nmetabolic stimulus, rather than those seeking to opti-\nmize maximal strength and power, where an emphasis\nis placed on complete recovery between sets and con-\ncentric performance during repetitions.",
    "conclusions": "The current meta-analysis concludes that while RTH\ndoes result in significant increases in muscular size\nand strength, these responses may not be larger\nthan NRT. Nevertheless, the findings from this\nmeta-analysis are likely impacted by the divergent\nmethodologies employed in RTH studies, particu-\nlarly around the structure of exercise, level of\nhypoxia used and the types of participants recruited.\nThe findings of this meta-analysis indicate the impor-\ntance of additional detailed studies to analyse the\neffects of this novel training stimulus on muscular\nsize and strength performance.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank all authors of the original works cited in the\npresent study, who readily assisted us by either\nsharing their manuscripts or providing additional\ndata required for this meta-analysis.\n10 D.
